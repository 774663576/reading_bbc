     BBC 英语教学所在的办公大楼里在装修，大家都需要找临时办公位工作。Rob 不知道他的座位到底在哪里，所以在楼里跑来跑去，像个无头苍蝇。不过，他的困惑给我们提供了一个学习新地道英语短语的好机会。听他们的对话，看菲菲用哪个短语形容 Rob “东奔西跑，四处奔走”。

     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲，但我的搭档 Rob 怎么还没来？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry, Feifei. I didn't know we were in this studio today.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. Studio 62D. It says it on this plan.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Really? The studios and offices are being refurbished and everything's a bit chaotic.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     最近我们的办公楼和录音间都在装修，所以办公室里比较乱。Calm down, Rob! Are things really that bad?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes! First I sat at my desk and was told to move to another one. And then when I sat at another desk, I was told the boss was sitting there…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     …so you had to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Of course! Then when I went to the studio, somebody was in there, reading the news! So I was told to find another studio…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, yes, I get it, Rob. You could say you were moved from pillar to post. From pillar to post 东奔西跑。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Exactly. You mean, going from one place to another in a disorganised and chaotic way?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I do. 短语 “from pillar to post” 指一个人从一处到另一处，东奔西跑，四处奔波。 Let's hear some examples of this phrase in action.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     We got moved from pillar to post on our tour so we started to complain – it's not what was promised in the holiday brochure!
    </p>
    <p>
     As a child, both my parents worked, so I got dragged from pillar to post trying to find someone to look after me.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was passed from pillar to post when I phoned the bank to try and pay my credit card bill.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。因为我们办公楼里在装修，办公室里的座位有调整，录音间也变了，这搞得 Rob 在楼里跑来跑去 “from pillar to post”。But, Rob, things don't have to be chaotic.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh yeah, why's that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If you just follow the temporary plan. 临时座位安排上写的很清楚我们的座位应该在哪里。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, let's have a look. Right – so we're meant to be in this studio – 62D.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes! And where is your desk?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Err, oh no, my desk is right behind a pillar! Nobody will be able to see me now. I'll have no one to talk to.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, I think this office refurbishment is going to be really good!
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Thanks. Are we at the end of the programme now?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. Bye.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye-bye.
