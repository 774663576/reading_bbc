     几乎没有人喜欢吃药，尤其是苦味、怪味重的药。单词“medicine 药”被用在表达“a taste of your own medicine” 中来代表“一个人对他人苛刻的言行”。那么品尝自己给别人的“medicine”会是一种什么样的感觉呢？节目中，Neil 和菲菲为你道来。

     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。

     … and I'm Neil. Hey Feifei, it sounds like you might have a cold.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     I think I have – sore throat, blocked nose. 我特别不舒服。That's why I'm taking this medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's probably a good idea. Medicine is usually good for making you feel better but how does it taste?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, it's supposed to taste of strawberries but to be honest it just tastes horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's why I never take the stuff – it's disgusting. Have you heard of the phrase 'a taste of your own medicine'?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A taste of your own medicine? 这个表达我没听过。不过感觉好像是和“不好的事情”有关系。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sort of. It describes someone receiving the same, treatment or unpleasant experience that they have given to someone else. You know, like you're always bossing people around and then someone starts to boss you around.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I don't know what you mean! 不过，我们还是来说说这个表达吧：a taste of your own medicine 形容一个人体会自己对他人的态度或行为，也就是你曾经怎么样对待别人，现在别人也用同样的方式对待你，让你自尝苦果，以其人之道，还治其人之身。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It is. Let's hear some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Our boss is so rude to us but finally somebody has answered back and now he's got a taste of his own medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I meet up with my boyfriend, he's always late so this time I'm going to give him a taste of his own medicine and turn up late as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deepak is always rude to the teacher but he was really offended when she gave him a taste of his own medicine and was rude back to him!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     好了，要提醒大家的是 a taste of your own medicine 这个表达极具贬义，所以在使用的时候要格外注意。Excuse me!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh dear. It sounds like you need to take some more medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If you mean literally taking the medicine, then yes. But if you mean receiving the same treatment I've given to someone else, then no. I can't believe you think I am always bossing people around.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I was just giving an example of the phrase. I would never say you are bossy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good. Now why don't you go and make me a nice up of tea?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, OK. Yep, sure. Sure thing.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And don't forget to close the door!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yep, right. OK, yep. Whatever you say. See you later.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, I feel better already. Bye.
