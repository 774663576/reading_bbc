     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Beth. We have an expression that describes exaggerating, praising someone or criticising someone a bit too much. It's 'lay it on thick'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     Lay it on thick. 这个表达的字面意思是 “刷油漆时刷得太厚”，实际意思是 “夸大情绪，过分地夸奖或过分地责备某人”。Can you give us an example, please?
    </p>

     Yes, well, my sister and I saw an actor we like the other day. The actor was just shopping in London and we said hi. But then my sister started crying because she was so excited to meet him. She really laid it on thick.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     Hmm, that does sound a bit much. Beth 的妹妹在街头看到自己喜欢的演员，激动得泪流满面。Beth 觉得妹妹的反应有点夸张，所以她说 “She really laid it on thick.”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And my sister told him he's the best actor in the world. That's definitely an exaggeration!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     That's a lot of flattery. Your sister really laid it on thick.
    </p>

     Let's hear some more examples.
    </p>

      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You laugh very loudly at your boss's jokes. You lay it on a bit thick. He's not that funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     He tells everyone how many countries he's visited. I know he likes travelling, but why lay it on so thick?
    </p>
    <p>
     She was so upset that she cried in the bathroom for an hour. I thought her brother laid it on a bit thick with the criticism about her hair.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们听了三个使用了 “lay it on thick” 的例句。我们可以用 “lay it on thick” 来描述某人 “夸大情绪，过分地吹捧或责备他人”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>

     Now, the phrase 'lay it on with a trowel' is also used, though it's not as common. Like 'lay it on thick', it means praise someone too much or exaggerate an emotion.
    </p>

     “Lay it on thick” 的另一个说法是 “lay it on with a trowel”，不过我们通常还是更多地使用 “lay it on thick”。Right, let's get back to work. We have another training session later. It's on how to book a meeting room, and we've already done that training twice this year!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. They are really laying it on with a trowel. See you next time!
    </p>

     Bye-bye.
