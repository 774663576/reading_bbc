    <p>
     有时候，一个善意的小谎话 “a fib” 可能无伤大雅。这不，Rob 明明搭火车上班，但偏说瞎话，告诉菲菲他是因为坐公共汽车，所以上班迟到了。他为什么要撒谎呢？听他们的对话，学习 “fib” 这个词的用法。

     大家好，这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我是冯菲菲。我的搭档 Rob 似乎又迟到了……
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yeah, don’t worry. Here I am! Yes, really sorry. That bus was really slow.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmmm… Bad on the roads today, huh?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Terrible traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That’s funny, because I took the train in this morning… and I saw you at the other end of the carriage…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Err, OK. Yes, sorry. Yes. I took the train, not the bus. Little fib there.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     Why would you want to fib about that? 不过没关系，这正好给了我们一个绝佳的机会来给大家讲讲 “fib” 和 “fibbing” 的意思和用法。You are very good at fibbing, Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, yes, to fib is to tell a small lie, nothing too serious. Like giving a false reason for being late. Come on, Feifei, you do it too!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei

     </strong>
     I’m always on time! Well, almost always. 我还是来讲讲 “fib” 的意思吧！它既可以作动词，也可以作名词。作动词的意思是 “撒小谎，说瞎话”；作名词时的意思是 “小谎”，比如：a little fib，tell a little fib 说个小谎。下面，咱们来一起听三个例句。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Marty fibbed that he was going to study at his friend Lucio’s house, when in fact they went to see a movie.
    </p>
    <p>
     While watching the horror scenes, Marty was so scared he had to close his eyes. But after the film he fibbed that he was not frightened at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Marty told Lucio that he knew the main actor from the movie, but that was just another fib. In fact Marty had just met the actor for five seconds and taken a quick selfie together.
    </p>

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们给大家分别举例讲解了 “fib” 作动词和名词时的用法。So anyway, I’m still a bit confused about why you had to fib about being late?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, I just had something to do before coming into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Really? That sounds mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Not really. I wanted to go to a shop.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Do tell me why.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, OK. Well, it was going to be a surprise, but I wanted to buy you a little cake, because it’s your birthday today and I can’t come to your party later.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, that’s so sweet. Though you know, it’s not really my birthday today.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. It’s on Saturday. Sorry, a little fib there. I told everyone it was my birthday today so they would be more likely to come to my party.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, right. Very sneaky! No worries. Enjoy the cake anyway. Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yum. Bye.
