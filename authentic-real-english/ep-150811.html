     大家好。欢迎收听地道英语。我是杨莉...

     <strong>
      Rob

     </strong>
     ...and me Rob. I suppose we had better explain an authentic English phrase then.
    </p>

     Oh cheer up Rob - why are you sounding so miserable?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, I wasn't going to say anything but... well, I've got problems... financial problems.

     Rob 遇到了经济困难，也就是钱方面的问题 - I'm sorry to hear that. What's happened?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I had to get my car fixed, I had to get a plumber round to fix a leaking pipe, I received a huge tax bill and then to add to it all, I lost my wallet yesterday - I'm doing my best to keep the wolf from the door.
    </p>

     一只狼？！不让狼进你家门？You really have got problems if you've got to keep a wolf out of your house!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Not a real wolf. When people say they're trying to keep the wolf from the door they mean they've only just got enough money to survive.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh I see! 原来所谓的“不让狼进门”这个比喻性的短语，意思就是“竭尽全力勉强度日，维持基本生存”或者说“将就能养家糊口，维持生存”。So you just have enough money to eat and live?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, it's not a good position to be in. Let's hear more examples of the phrase in action...
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm going to have to sell my car if I'm to keep the wolf from the door.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     It's tough being a student, I study all day then have to do an evening job just to keep the wolf from the door.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     We've only just saved enough money to keep the wolf from the door.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     这么说你的钱只够一家人糊口，维持生存。 OK Rob, I get it… with all your bills to pay you really are struggling to keep the wolf from the door - so what are you going to do?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I need to ask a really good friend to lend me some money.

     <strong>
      Li

     </strong>
     Rob 希望有谁能借给他一点儿钱 - so you need to find a good friend then?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, a really good friend - like you Li? I know you have some spare cash.

     Sorry Rob, I've just spent that on a really nice holiday.

     It sounds like the wolf is

     at the door. Go on then, here's £10.
