     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Phil. We have a phrase which means to know about something or be involved in it. It's 'in on something'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     In on something. 短语 “in on something” 的意思是 “了解或参与到一件事情当中去”。What's something that we can be in on, Phil?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, you know there are all those discussions about where we have our team meal? I could ask you if you are in on these discussions?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm not in on them. 我没参与讨论去哪里吃团建餐。And seeing as no one ever seems to be able to agree, I'm glad I'm not in on them. Let the others sort it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That sounds sensible. So, here 'in on' means 'be involved in'. If you are 'in on' an argument, discussion, or project, it means you are involved in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     是的，如果 “you are in on an argument, discussion, or project”，意思就是 “你参与一场争辩、参与一次讨论或参与一个项目”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Now, that's the 'be involved' in meaning of 'in on', but it can also be about knowing about something.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     没错，短语 “in on something” 还可以用来表示 “知道一个秘密”。“Let someone in on something” 就是 “让某人知道一件事情”。I'll let you in on a secret – the team meal that everyone's arguing about, I heard from the boss that the company's paying for it, if they can ever agree about where to go – but it's a secret, I shouldn't really be letting you in on it.
    </p>

     OK, forget we said that. Listen to these examples instead.

      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That project looks like so much fun. I really need to get in on it!
    </p>
    <p>
     We're planning a surprise party for Ahmed. We're all in on the secret, but don't tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Are you in on the latest news about Paula? It's so exciting, I can't wait to tell you.
    </p>

     We often use it with the verb 'let' when it is about a secret, or 'get' if it's about being involved in something.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei

     Sometimes if you manage to get in on something exciting, they let you in on a lot of secrets that not many other people know!
