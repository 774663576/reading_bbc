     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and hello, I'm Rob. So Feifei, how was your holiday – did you go anywhere special?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I did. I went walking.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Very healthy. So, where did you go?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, I walked up Mount Everest…. It was tough and cold but I made it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Errr… you walked up Mount Everest – the highest mountain in the world – are you sure?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Rob 不相信我登上了珠穆朗玛峰。You don't think I'm fit enough to do it, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No no no, it's just… oh come on Feifei, you're pulling my leg.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'm not even touching you.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, I don't mean you're actually pulling my leg – I mean you're lying aren't you – you're joking with me?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     原来 pull someone’s leg 这个英语表达的意思是在开玩笑时故意哄骗或逗某人玩。所以，Rob 说我在逗他玩儿，因为他觉得我根本没有爬上珠穆朗玛峰的能力。不过我是真的在骗他吗？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Come on Feifei, stop teasing me – you didn't do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I did. I'll show you some photos. But let me hear some more examples of the phrase in action first.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A: So I got to the restaurant and sat down at my table and guess who was sitting on at the next table – George Clooney!
     <br/>
     B: You're pulling my leg!
    </p>
    <p>
     I was pulling his leg when I said I was going to marry Jenny but he believed me and bought me a present!
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh stop pulling my leg – you can't have won the lottery, you didn't even buy a ticket!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     表达 pull someone’s leg 的意思就是愚弄、哄骗某人，但请大家记住这种哄骗都是开玩笑的、无恶意的行为。Look at this photo Rob, you can see how much snow there was on Everest – and look, there's me on top.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hold on – this is a trick photo – you had this taken in one of those photo-booths where you stand in front of a big screen. You're not pulling my leg!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ooo… ouch… 我的大腿肌肉好像抻到了。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It looks like you've pulled something in your own leg – a muscle perhaps! Who's the fool now?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, I didn't walk up Everest – I was teasing you but you almost believed me!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Did!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Did not.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Did.
