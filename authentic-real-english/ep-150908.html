     大家好，欢迎收听《地道英语》，我是冯菲菲，还有我的搭档…

     And me Rob. Hello!

    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So Rob, what's that thing you've got over there?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh this? It's a barrel [tapping on wooden barrel]…
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     大木桶 a barrel。I see.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And do you want to know what's inside the barrel?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Not really.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK – well if I open the lid you'll be able to hear [Opens lid and sounds of laughing] – funny isn't it?!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     [not impressed] You have a barrel of laughs“一桶笑声”。And that is supposed to be funny?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's supposed to illustrate today's piece of authentic real English. It's hilarious, isn't it! And you know what – the phrase 'a barrel of laughs' can be used to describe me – someone who is fun and always joking around.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Really? 原来短语 a barrel of laughs 可以用来形容那些总是喜欢开玩笑，给人们带来快乐的人。But this doesn't describe you Rob – you're not funny.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh? What?! I think we better hear some examples of this phrase in action – and I'll show you how funny I really am…
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I shall miss having John in the office. He was such a barrel of laughs.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     What a barrel of laughs that bus driver was. He made the long journey much more fun with his funny announcements!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     Since I split up with my boyfriend, life hasn't been a barrel of laughs.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     这么说，其实这个短语可以理解为汉语里常说的“开心果”，形容一个幽默的、逗人开心笑的人。谁说不是呢，我们都喜欢身边有个“开心果”。
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     By the way, 'a barrel of laughs' can also be used to describe a thing, such as a TV show. But come on Feifei, you have to agree, this barrel full of laughs is so funny! Listen again [Opens lid again: laughter].
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm, it's a cheap joke but it's not funny. I know what you can do if you want to make me laugh…
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh yes – go on, what is it?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Why don't you see if you can fit inside the barrel?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, right, well, that sounds like a laugh. OK, here goes… [Sound of Rob getting in] Getting in… I'm in Feifei.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Wow Rob – you actually fit in the barrel! 我算是佩服了，Rob 还真能钻进这个木桶 里去。我只需要把桶盖儿盖上就行了。That's so funny!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hey, Feifei, what are you doing?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">

     Making you into a real life 'barrel of laughs'

     That's not funny.
