     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And I'm Rob. Hello.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hey, Rob, how is your application to run in the marathon going?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      <br/>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Umm… not great. I fill in a form and then I’m told to fill in another one.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Have you tried phoning someone?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. And they won't give me a straight answer. They just keep giving me the runaround.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, that makes sense. If you're going to run in a marathon, you've got to run around.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, Feifei. Giving someone the runaround does not involve any exercise. If you give someone the runaround, it means you behave in an unhelpful way – possibly sending someone from one place to another to get help. If you are given the runaround, it can be very frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'm sure it is. “Give someone the runaround” 这个短语的字面意思是 “让某人跑来跑去”，它实际所表达的意思是 “不愿意帮忙，打发人，搪塞人”。I know lots of situations where I have been given the runaround.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, there's one place where you won't be given the runaround. It's here, with some helpful examples of this phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     When I called the bank to ask for a loan, they just gave me the runaround.
    </p>
    <p>
     She went to the hospital to get the results of her test, but she just got the runaround. Now she’s going to make a formal complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
     When I complained about the bill, I was told to speak to the boss, but he wasn't there – I think I’m just being given the runaround.
    </p>

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。本集节目里教给大家的表达是 “give someone the runaround”。它的意思是 “故意不帮忙，打发人，搪塞人”。And, Rob, you've been given the runaround.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I have. All I want to do is get a place in the marathon – but nobody seems to want to help me.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Could it be that you're so unfit that they just don't want to give you a place?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ha, I don't think so. I've been training for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I managed to get a place straight away – with no runaround.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What! You are running the marathon too – why didn't you tell me? Right, I'm going to phone them again and demand a place.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And don't be given the runaround this time, Rob!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I won't. See you at the start line.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
