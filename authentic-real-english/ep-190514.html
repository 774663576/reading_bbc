     你会骑自行车吗？骑自行车这项本领，一旦学会，就再也忘不了。在本集节目中，Neil 用地道表达 “like riding a bike” 做比喻，描述自己的攀岩本领。攀岩和骑自行车之间有什么关系？听对话，学习一个新的实用表达。

     That I did! I went away this weekend to do some rock climbing!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     How exciting! I didn’t think that would be your kind of thing!
     <br/>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     What are you saying, Feifei? That I’m not in good shape? Well, OK, fair point. It has been a long time since I’ve been rock climbing, but I used to go all the time. I may not have the stamina any more, but I still have the technique. It was like riding a bike.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     What? You rode a bike while climbing? Or did you carry the bike up with you? What are you talking about, Neil?!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No, I was struggling to pull myself up the rocks, never mind a bike! What I meant is that it’s a skill I will always have and always remember.
     <br/>
     <br/>

     原来，“It’s like riding a bike.” 这个说法实际所表达的意思是 “学过的东西就忘不了”。好比学骑自行车，只要学会了，不管多久不骑，都不会忘记怎么骑。咱们来听几个使用了 “It’s like riding a bike.” 的例句。

      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Though it’s been a while since I made a video, I managed to do it easily – it was like riding a bike.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I used to do a lot of baking with my mother as a child, and recently I’ve got back into it. It’s like riding a bike really.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     I know it’s been a long time since you’ve done any knitting, but honestly, it’s like riding a bike.
     <br/>

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。本集节目中教给大家的表达是 “It’s like riding a bike.”。它用 “像骑自行车一样” 作比喻，说明一项技能只要学会了，就永远不会忘记。So Neil said that rock climbing, an activity he used to do all the time, was like riding a bike.
     <br/>

     That’s right, Feifei – it was difficult because it was tiring, but I remembered with ease how to tie the ropes and all the best techniques. The idea is that once you’ve learnt to do something, like riding a bike, you will never forget that skill.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     Well, it seems that setting up the studio is not like riding a bike for you, Neil. The volume in my headphones is way too loud!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh dear, I think I’d best get away from here as fast as I can before Feifei gets really mad! Where's my bike…? Thanks for joining us, everyone!
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Feifei

     Goodbye!
