     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或者短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm here with Phil. What have you been doing, Phil?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I've just been doing my Christmas shopping. It's so hard to find things for everyone. I don't really know what people are going to like.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You know what? You can't go wrong with gift vouchers. Let people decide what they want as a present for themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That might be a good idea! And, actually, there's a good expression for this episode, 'you can't go wrong with'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, if you want to make a suggestion, and say that it's guaranteed to succeed, or at least very likely to succeed, you can say 'you can't go wrong with'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, if you were looking for the perfect Christmas party idea, would you agree that you can't go wrong with karaoke?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm not sure about that, Phil. I've heard you singing! I reckon you can't go wrong with a good meal, then everyone's happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's hear some examples of 'you can't go wrong with'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     There's a sauce called gravy which goes with a Christmas dinner, and I think if you add a teaspoon of mustard, it's really great. You can't go wrong with a teaspoon of mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
     I never know what film to watch but at this time of year, you can't go wrong with a Christmas movie. They're always so cosy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone loves Italian food. I just think you can't go wrong with pasta or pizza.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们一起学习了表达 “can't go wrong” 的用法。
    </p>
    <p>
     As well as 'can't go wrong' – you'll also hear 'you can't go far wrong' or 'you won't go far wrong'. They mean the same thing, and we use them in the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You mean, I could say 'if you want to learn new English expressions, you can't go far wrong with listening to this programme'?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's right! You won't go far wrong if you listen to us!
    </p>
    <p>
     在英语中，如果我们说某件事 “go wrong”，意思就是 “出问题了”。而表达 “can't go wrong” 的意思就是 “不会出错”。我们通常用这个表达向他人提出建议，或给出一个我们认为不会出问题的选择。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And while we need to finish now, you won't go far wrong if you come back for the next episode. Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye-bye!
