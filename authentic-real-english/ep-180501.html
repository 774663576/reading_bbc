    <p>
     菲菲昨天晚上玩得很尽兴，所以早上睡过了头，上班迟到了。这个经历是不是给了菲菲一个教训？在日常对话中，我们可以使用口语表达“that’ll teach you”来告诉别人“要吸取这次犯错的教训”。来学习这个表达的相关用法。

     Hello, welcome to Authentic Real English with me, Neil and errr… where's Feifei?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     哎，对不起，我来晚了。大家好！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Goodness, it's not like you to be late. You're always so punctual and smartly dressed. But today you look a mess, if you don't mind me saying.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     什么？你说我看起来乱七八糟、蓬头垢面？I do mind you saying, Neil. It's been a very stressful morning. I didn't have time to shower, iron my clothes or even have breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm. Did you get up late by any chance?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, you're right. I forgot to set my alarm last night. 所以早上睡过了头！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Has this got anything to do with you going out last night? I suppose you're going to tell me you had such a great time, you stayed out later than expected?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, how did you guess? 不过昨晚真是玩得非常开心，我很久都没有这么尽兴了！But I'm regretting it now!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Ah well, that'll teach you for staying out late,enjoying yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     “That'll teach me?” I'm not going to school, nobody is going to 'teach me' not to stay out late.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's just a saying Feifei. You might say it to someone to suggest that they should learn from the bad effects of doing something and not repeat it in the future. In other words, your stress this morning is a suitable punishment for staying out late last night – you won't do it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You sound like my parents! 原来，在英语，我们可以用“that’ll teach you”这个非常口语化的表达来告诉别人应该从一个不好的事情的后果中吸取教训，也就相当于我们汉语里常说的“这回你可长记性了吧！”
    </p>

     These examples might explain the phrase better.

      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You lent some money to Dan and he didn't pay you back – that'll teach you!
    </p>
    <p>
     My brother got a speeding ticket for driving too fast down the high street – that'll teach him!
    </p>
    <p>
     The footballer got a red card for his bad tackle and now he'll miss playing in the final – that'll teach him!

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我们刚刚为大家介绍了一个非正式的英语表达“that’ll teach you”。这句话是用来提醒别人，“这次你知道做某事的后果了吧”或者“这回你可得从中吸取教训了。”I guess we could say 'it serves you right!'?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, it's a very informal but blunt way of saying 'your suffering is your own fault'. And for you it's true.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     But do you know what, Neil? Despite my suffering, I had a really good night out.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh did you? And who did you have this 'great night out' with?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Everyone from the office. We all went to the pub. That'll teach you for leaving the office early, Neil. You left too early and you missed out!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm. That's enough teaching for one day. I'm off.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye!
