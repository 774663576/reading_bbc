     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目，我是佳莹。

     <br/>
     And hello, I’m Neil. Hey, Jiaying, we were all thinking about going to that new restaurant for lunch. Do you want to come?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, thanks. I went the other day and once is enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, you didn’t enjoy it? Was the food bad?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It wasn’t terrible, but it was a bit of a curate’s egg!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What’s that? The restaurant only sells eggs? That sounds a bit rubbish!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, Neil. 我说的是 “curate’s egg”。我们用表达 “curate’s egg” 来指 “好坏参半、不好不坏的事物”。我们常用它来描述一样不好的事物，但这个事物也有可取之处，有 “还凑合” 的意思。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So when you said the restaurant was a curate’s egg, you were saying it wasn’t a great experience. What was wrong with it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I’ll tell you after we listen to some examples of this expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That new film is a curate’s egg. Great action, but the story and acting were awful.
    </p>
    <p>
     The day ended up being a bit of a curate’s egg. It was nice to see my friends, but after the car broke down and I got wet in the rain, I wasn’t happy.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think her new novel is a curate’s egg. It has moments of brilliance, but overall it felt a bit of a let-down.
    </p>
    <p>

     你正在收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们正在介绍表达 “curate’s egg”。我们用它来表示一件事物 “好坏参半，还凑合”。Like when I said that restaurant was a curate’s egg.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yeah! What was wrong with it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, for one – the food was a curate’s egg. It tasted nice but the cooks were so slow that the food was cold! Then the waiters were nice, but they kept dropping things.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     They sound a bit of a curate’s egg as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes – and finally the decor. It was really vibrant and bright which was nice at first, but after a while, it gave me a real headache.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sounds like the whole experience really was a bit of a curate’s egg. I think I’ll suggest somewhere different to the team.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good idea! Bye, Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
