     Hello and welcome to Authentic Real English. 大家好，我是菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and I'm Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil，谢谢你送我的礼物。我特别喜欢！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I know you love tea, and I heard that you smashed your favourite teapot – so what better present than a BBC Learning English teapot?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Exactly. A teapot is the gift that keeps on giving!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What?! Keep on giving gifts? I'm sorry, Feifei, I can only afford one gift for you this year! I can't keep giving you gifts. How rich do you think I am?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     我可不是说让你一直给我送礼物！我刚才说 “the gift that keeps on giving”。我们用这个表达来描述一件事情或一种情况的好处在很长一段时间内不断重复展现，制造惊喜。So, in the case of the teapot, it's something really useful that I can keep on using!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah… that makes sense. And it's not just for presents, right? For example, that silly video of Roy singing always makes me laugh. It's the gift that keeps on giving.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What silly video? We can talk more about this video while we listen to these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That subscription to the video streaming site you gave me is the gift that keeps on giving.
    </p>
    <p>
     That marketing campaign went viral, and people are still watching the video ten years later. It's the gift that keeps on giving.
    </p>
    <p>
     My investment in shares is the gift that keeps on giving. I get dividends every month.

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在这期节目中，我们一起学习表达 “the gift that keeps on giving” 的意思和用法。在日常生活中，我们可以用 “the gift that keeps on giving” 来指 “一个可以给我们带来源源不断的礼物或惊喜的事物”。I've just watched that video of Roy singing. It's hilarious!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I know. It makes me laugh every time I watch it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It really is the gift that keeps on giving! I didn't know Roy could reach such high notes!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I particularly loved it when the dog started howling with him!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I think I'm going to watch it again while I have a nice cup of tea made in that teapot you gave me! Would you like a cup of tea?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, yes, please! Tea is always a good idea!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
