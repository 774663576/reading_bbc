     欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。大家好，我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And I'm Roy! I'm so excited! You made me so happy when you messaged me what we're doing today!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     我们马上要参加一个非常重要的会议。你为什么这么高兴？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I thought we were playing a selection of classic board games!? I brought my favourite game.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Why on earth would you bring a selection of board games to a huge meeting?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You told me in your message to bring a game! You were very clear!
    </p>
    <p>
     Feifei
     <br/>
     No, Roy! 我说 “bring your A game”，不是让你带一个桌上游戏。“A game” 的意思是 “某人最好的状态”。我是让你带着自己最好的状态来参加这个重要的会议。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Right. Well, clearly, I have brought my A game – and a great board game that we can play after we are successful in the meeting!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Roy, if you manage to convince everyone of my plan, I'll play your stupid game! Let's listen to these examples while we have a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Claus brought his A game to the meeting and sealed the deal.
    </p>
    <p>
     That team won the match easily! They brought their A game.
    </p>
    <p>
     Erica didn't bring her A game to the quiz, and we lost by a point.
    </p>

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上，我们介绍了 “A game” 的意思和用法。“A game” 指的就是某人 “最好的状态，最巅峰的表现”。我们通常会听到 “bring your A game” 这个说法，意思就是 “拿出你最好的状态，全力以赴”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it's commonly used with the verb 'bring' and a possessive pronoun like 'your'. You're very lucky that I brought my A game to the meeting, but it really didn't seem like a truly vital and important meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It was for me! I'm just really happy you managed to convince them that I needed an indoor golf course in the office! And now, I believe I owe you something!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, you promised to play the board game I brought with me today!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, not that. It looks boring, and I don't want to fall asleep. I was thinking of playing some golf.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, OK. I like golf. I'm not very good at it, so I'll have to bring my A game if I want to beat you.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You're not playing – I'll let you carry my clubs while I play as a reward for your hard work in the meeting. So, don't worry about bringing your A game. Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
