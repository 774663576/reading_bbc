     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And I’m Rob. And I am so excited!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, yeah? Why's that, Rob?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You know, Feifei. It's that festive time of year – presents, parties, time with the family, snow… And, um, did I mention presents?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, you did. Presents 礼物，parties 派对，family time 家人团聚的时间，还有 snow 白雪。Yes, Rob. It's Christmas time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, come on, Feifei – aren't you excited? Imagine if we had lots of Christmases all at the same time!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Err, no. Think of the cost of buying all those presents!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yeah, but hopefully you'd receive lots of presents, too! Anyway, do you know that for some people, all their Christmases can come all at once?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     “All their Christmases can come all at once.” 这是什么意思？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, well, they're not really Christmases, but if someone has extreme good fortune, it's like the feeling of having lots of Christmases all at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     啊！原来是这个意思。我们可以用 “to have all your Christmases come at once” 这个说法来形容一个人的运气极佳，好运连连，就好比同时过好多个圣诞节一样。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Let's hear from some people who've had all their Christmases come at once. Lucky them!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yay! I got a pay rise, and I'm off on holiday tomorrow. And I’ve won the lottery! It seems like all my Christmases have come at once!
    </p>
    <p>
     The day I got married, I heard I'd passed my exams and got a promotion, so it felt like all my Christmases had come at once.
    </p>
    <p>
     All my Christmases have come at once! My parents bought me a new car. I got a place at university and I've got a new girlfriend!
    </p>

     It will be. Happy Christmas, Rob!

     Same to you, Feifei.
