    </h3>
    <p>
     Finn 马上要去泰国度假，特别高兴。于是 Rob 用了一个和春天有关的成语来形容 Finn 的这种好心情。不过 Feifei 带给 Finn 的消息恐怕会使他的好心情一扫而光。

     <br/>
     大家好，欢迎收听《地道英语》。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And hello, I'm Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hey Rob, have you seen Finn today?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I saw him just a few minutes ago… same old Finn.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     But when I saw him he was very cheerful… smiling and he was singing too!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, nothing wrong with singing at work.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I know… but he just seems a bit…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Full of the joys of spring?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     充满了春天的欢乐？Erm, I don't think so – it's winter Rob – cold and wet.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No Feifei! The season might be winter but Finn's behaviour, or his mood, is cheerful and lively – like springtime – bright, sunny, flowers growing, new animals being born, birds flying around…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm that does sound like spring. 我们可以用 full of the joys of spring 这个表达来形容某人充满喜悦，因为春天是个万物复苏，万象更新的季节。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, let's hear some more examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Emily's full of the joys of spring today – her boyfriend has just asked her to marry him!
    </p>
    <p>
     Raj seems full of the joys of spring today – he must have some good news about his exam results.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm full of the joys of spring today – I've just won £1,000 in the lottery – now, what shall I spend it on?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     充满了“春天的欢乐的人”肯定是有好心情喽。 But Rob, why is Finn in such a good mood?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He's happy because he's going on holiday tomorrow – swapping our cold winter for two weeks in the sun, on the beach in Thailand!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Lucky Finn! Finn 心情好原来是因为他要去泰国度假. But hold on Rob… there's a strike at the airport tomorrow. All flights are cancelled. Does he know that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I don't think so. Shall we tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I don't know. That will make him 'empty of the joys of spring' …
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and full of the misery of winter!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Is that another idiom?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, I just made it up. Come on then, I'll go and tell him.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye bye.
