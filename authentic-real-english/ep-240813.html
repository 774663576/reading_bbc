     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的表达。I'm Feifei, and I'm here with Beth.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hi everyone. Hi Feifei, how are you?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'm very well, thank you Beth. In this programme, we are actually going to learn a word which I heard you use when you were talking about food. It was 'top-notch'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, yes! 'Top-notch'. So, yeah, earlier I was talking about going to my brother's house where I had some amazing plant-based food. I couldn't believe how tasty it was with no meat or dairy. It was top-notch.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sounds lovely, I'd love to try it. So, top-notch is an adjective that means something is of very high standard or high quality. And we can use it for people, too. I actually had some top-notch food recently too.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     What did you have?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, I went to an independent cafe around the corner from my house, and they make the best carrot cake. It was top-notch, so delicious.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Sounds really good.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Beth, can we use the 'top-notch' for things other than food?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, we can. So, for example, I went to the theatre recently. I saw a show in the West End, and it was top-notch. The singing was phenomenal, the dancing was amazing. It was really good.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So it was top-notch!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It was. Now here are some more examples of the adjective 'top-notch.'
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     My friend wrote a book and asked me to read it. I thought it was going to be really bad, but actually it was top-notch. I really enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I went to a conference last week, and all of the presentations were absolutely top-notch.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I've just got back from holiday. I was expecting the hotel to be pretty bad, but it was actually top-notch.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     We can also use the word 'top-notch' to talk about business-related things. For example, you might be hiring someone for a job and you see a top-notch CV that makes you give that person an interview.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, and in this case you could also say that 'I saw a CV that was top-notch'. So, 'top-notch' 是个形容词，它的意思是 “顶尖的，一流的”，它可以形容物品，也可以形容人。比如，我们可以用 “top-notch” 来形容食物是 “一流的，美味的”。“The food in this restaurant is top-notch.” 再比如，我们可以用 “top-notch” 来形容一个人是 “出类拔萃的”。“Beth is a top-notch presenter.”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, thank you! So, to recap, we've learnt the phrase 'top-notch' which means very high quality.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And that's all from us. We'll be back next week. Bye-bye!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
