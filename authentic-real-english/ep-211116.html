     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目，我是佳莹。

      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and hello, it’s me, Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil – what’s wrong? You look a little sad!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, earlier, the owner of the local coffee shop laughed at me! She said that my purple suit made me look ridiculous – she said I looked like a big grape!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I hope you clapped back!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I certainly did not! I just bought my coffee and left. Why would I clap her horrible comment? I don’t want to applaud it!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     不是那个意思，Neil！我说的是 “clap back”，意思是 “回击” 或 “回嘴”。你可以用这个短语来表示 “在受到某人的批评之后，回击、顶嘴、顶回去”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good point! I should have said that if she doesn’t like my suit, I won’t drink coffee from her shop ever again!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, you should have clapped back with that! But now let’s listen to these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     When she said his sponge cake wasn’t nice, he clapped back and said she made bad cups of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don’t clap back at me! I wasn’t trying to criticise you when I said you need to change your t-shirt!
    </p>
    <p>
     She clapped back by telling him he was the worst driver in the world.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面，我们介绍了短语 “clap back”，意思是 “反击某人对你的批评，顶回去”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes! Like the other day when someone said they didn’t like the music you were listening to, and you clapped back and said he had bad taste in music.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Haha, yes! I don’t know why he said that – I was listening to it on my headphones!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I have to say you do listen to the music pretty loudly – everyone can hear it – even on your headphones.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Are you criticising the loudness of my music?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No! I would never criticise you – I don’t want you to clap back!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good! Anyway, I’m going to go and listen to some music. Bye, Neil!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, I’ll get some earplugs. Bye!
