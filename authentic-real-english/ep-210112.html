     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And I'm Roy! Hey, Feifei, do you fancy doing some karaoke tonight with me and Rob?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, I do not. The last time we went out with Rob, you two managed to upset everyone. Everyone left. He is tone deaf!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     His singing is not that bad! His mum says he's got a lovely voice!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     虽然 “tone deaf” 可以形容 “听不准音调，唱歌时五音不全的人”，但现在它更多地用来形容 “听不进去别人的声音，对他人的反馈充耳不闻的人”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, so you mean that fact that Rob said that he prefers cats during the annual dog welfare meeting. Yeah, that was a bit off.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He always says the wrong things at the wrong time! He really is tone deaf. Let's listen to these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     People who say they've enjoyed lockdown can sound a bit tone deaf. So many people have lost their jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     We've all been working so hard – the boss seemed tone deaf when he rejected our pay rise.
    </p>
    <p>
     I can't believe Sarah said she doesn't believe in global warming to those activists. She's tone deaf.
    </p>
    <p>

     <br/>
     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们正在介绍 “tone deaf” 这个表达的现代用法。它既可以描述一个人 “五音不全”，也可以形容某人 “听不进去他人的声音，对他人的感受、反馈或状况不敏感，充耳不闻”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. It's an interesting development of the meaning. So, 'deaf' refers to someone who can't hear, while 'tone deaf' describes someone who can't hear different tones or sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, that's right. And the new meaning is for someone who says the wrong thing at the wrong time – like Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it sometimes gets used to refer to authority figures who say something that seems to be out-of-touch with a certain situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's right! And, Roy, please don't sing tonight. You really are tone deaf when it comes to singing. Your singing makes dogs bark.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yeah, maybe that's for the best. But then I think the dogs just want to be in the same band as me. I could create a new band called 'Roy and the Dogs'!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I can't believe you just said that! I just formed a band called 'Feifei and the Cats' – your comment was tone deaf. Bye, Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
