     欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。大家好，我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And me, Roy! Have you seen Rob’s new video on social media?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it’s amazing! He has charm and style. He just has…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ooof!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes! Oomph! Rob has oomph and charm – not as much as me, of course, but he has some! Wow, Roy! For once, you actually got the correct word! Oomph!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I didn’t say ‘oomph’. I said ‘ooof’! I was complaining because I hurt my back earlier putting your cases in your car for you to go on your workation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, one can never be too prepared when going to the beach. Besides, I need lots of different outfits for when I take pictures. My photos have to have real…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     ‘Oomph’! Yes, I get it. Your photos need to have energy and be exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Exactly! Well, let’s talk more about my oomph right after these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上，我们听到了一些可以使用 “oomph” 的场景例句。在日常生活中，我们用 “oomph” 来形容 “充满活力、热情四射的人” 或 “动力强劲的事物”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Some people argue that it is important to have real oomph when making presentations. I’m really good at talking to a room full of people, which means I must have real oomph!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     充满活力，魅力四射的人是我！I am the one with the oomph! I could sell anything to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, if I bought what you were selling, I could resell it for double the price – that’s how much oomph I’ve got!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, Roy. You don’t have oomph. You have a puppy-like charm. It’s OK to be envious of my oomph!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Puppy-like? I don’t chew slippers or chase sticks! I have oomph! Energy! Excitement! People have told me that!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And who said that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Rob. But ironically, he said it when he hurt his back helping me with your cases.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I think we all know what he really said! Bye, Roy!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
