     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我是冯菲菲。

     … and I'm Roy!
    </p>

     <br/>
     哇，Roy，你的胡子又留长了！我那天在社交媒体上看到你发了张你没留胡子的样子。你看，就这张！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's not me. That's a picture of my son. He does look like me, but he's a lot younger than me.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei

     <br/>
     你发的每张照片都是你儿子的，你可真是喜欢 “晒娃”！
    </p>

     I am not sharenting! I know what that means. It's for people who share way too many photos of their children! I do not share too much! Besides, he's really cute!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He is cute, because he looks like his mother! But you need to be careful how much your share. Let's talk more about sharenting after these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There are many pros and cons of sharenting. We need to think about them before we post all these photos of our children.
    </p>
    <p>
     He needs to stop sharenting! I see so many photos of his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eric, I'm tired of your constant sharenting. Aren't you worried that your son won't be happy about this in the future?
    </p>

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语”。我们正在给大家介绍新词 “sharenting” 的意思和用法。 “Sharenting” 指 “父母过度地在社交媒体平台上发布自家孩子的照片或近况”；而这类酷爱分享的父母们就可以被称为 “sharents（分享父母）”。Roy, you are a sharent!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Haha, I am not! I'm just really proud of my son. I do agree that you need to be careful when sharing things about your children.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, there has to be a barrier between public and private life.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's why I only share videos and photos of him doing things like playing football. Have you seen how good he is? He's like the new Pele!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I have – he's really good. And I don't think that's sharenting. And I suppose even though you post a lot, there's nothing too personal. So, I'll stop calling you a sharent.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I think 'sharenting' is related to too much information. We need to also think about what we post, because in the future, my son may be very angry if I embarrass him with a silly picture of him dressed up like a giant parrot.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     But there is a photo of your son dressed as a giant parrot! He looks ridiculous. You should remove that photo.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's not my son – it's me. I like dressing in animal costumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Wow, he really does look like you, Roy. Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
