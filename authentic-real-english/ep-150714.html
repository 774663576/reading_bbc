     Hello Rob. You look so busy, 这都是些什么呀？What are all these papers?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, Feifei, I have to get a permit to build an extension to my house. It's a very small bit of building work but I have to fill in all these forms.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     What is this one for?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     This one here is for my local council. I need to apply for planning permission. And then they want lots of supporting documents to make sure it fits in with building regulations.
    </p>
    <p>

     It sounds exhausting. Rob 想把他们家的房子扩建一下，不过申请手续非常繁琐，得填写无数表格。
    </p>

     I hate red tape. If I could cut through this red tape it would be brilliant!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So your problem is red tape? 你需要剪断红色胶带纸？太容易了！Say no more, Rob! The solution is in my bag! ... Ah, here they are!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     A pair of scissors and blue tape?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. 你不是说要 cut through the red tape 吗？我给你了剪刀，你一剪就行了! If you don't like red tape, use blue. I love the colour blue!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     Thank you, Feifei. You're a good friend. But in English we call the rules and processes required to get official permits - which usually seem to be pointless - 'red tape'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Ah, bureaucracy! 原来在英语里，很多官方的规定、条款和繁琐的做事程序被称为 red tape “红带文件”，也就是我们说的“官僚作风”。下面我们来听几个例句。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Small firms won't be subject to new regulations under a government plan to cut red tape and boost the economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Andrea almost gave up studying abroad. The amount of red tape to get a visa was unbelievable!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I think most people hate bureaucracy, Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm not surprised. Some people say this expression might come from the 16th century, when bundles of documents were held together with red tape. I hate all these forms.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     据说，早在16世纪时的英国，所有官方的 文件会用红色布带系成一扎一扎的，从而也就出现了 red tape 这个比喻。Well, it's the 21st century now and we still have red tape. Good luck with your red tape, Rob. I'm off to paint the town red!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh Feifei, no more idioms with red for me today please.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Both
      <br/>

     Bye.
