     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。先来介绍我的搭档 Rob。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And you are Feifei. So, Feifei, how did the blind date go?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Not great. 我去相亲，但又失败了，都怪 Rob。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, no! Why didn't you just follow my advice?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I did! Wear something nice, turn up late and make small talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, exactly – make small talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, when I started making small talk, the guy looked at me in a strange way and then walked off!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, no! What did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Things like 'hi', 'good', 'yes', 'no', 'great' – small words.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Umm… But no sentences? I think you've got the wrong end of the stick here – I mean you've misunderstood – making small talk means making informal conversation about unimportant things. If you're meeting someone for the first time, it's a good way to make them feel relaxed. You know, break the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     原来 Rob 让我和相亲的对象礼貌寒暄，东拉西扯地聊一聊，谈一些轻松的话题，不用特别严肃，这样双方都会感到比较放松。人们把这种寒暄、交谈的方式称为  “small talk”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I guess we should hear some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I didn't know anybody at my cousin's wedding so I tried to make small talk with the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm shy and not very good at small talk. That's why I hate going to parties.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the office party, we all had to stand around making small talk, but all I really wanted to do was go home!
    </p>
    <p>

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。本集节目里介绍的表达是 “small talk”，它指的是与不认识或不熟悉的人之间的寒暄和对话。这类对话通过谈论轻松的话题使交谈双方感到更放松，避免尴尬的沉默。 Actually, Rob, I do know about small talk, it's just that…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, so why didn't you say?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I was going to tell you that…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You'll never get a boyfriend if you don't speak up, Feifei! You really need to talk more.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What I was trying to say was, I did not have time for small talk because my date would not stop talking. He was rude, arrogant and wouldn't let me get a word in edgeways! Now who does that remind me of?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Umm… Nice weather for the time of year, don't you think?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It's a bit late for small talk now, Rob. You've said far too much.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye-bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
