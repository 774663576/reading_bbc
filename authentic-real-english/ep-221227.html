     Hello and welcome to Authentic Real English. 大家好，我是菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and I'm Neil. Wow! That food smells amazing! What is it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It's part of my new diet! 我的新年决心是要健康饮食！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You're making me hungry. I'm really impressed with your new healthy lifestyle! Congratulations!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes! It's a change for the better!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What? A change for the butter? You've started eating only butter? Nothing else?! That doesn't sound like a balanced diet!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     你听错了，我刚才说 “a change for the better”。我们用 “a change for the better” 来描述 “一个人的状态变好了，事物的条件改善了”。For example, my new diet is an improvement in the way I eat.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah… that makes sense. And now I can see what you're eating! So many vegetables! Compared with the takeaway food you used to eat, it really is a change for the better! Maybe you can give me some advice on what to eat!
    </p>
    <p>

     We can talk more about that after these examples.
    </p>

     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The new manager brought in some new plants and repainted the office. The new look really was a change for the better.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many people feel that four-day working weeks would be a change for the better.
    </p>
    <p>
     The decision to change the focus of the project was a change for the better.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们举例讲解了如何用 “a change for the better” 来描述 “人的行为、态度有了好转或事物的状况、质量有了改进”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So when I stopped eating meat, I felt that it was a change for the better for me! I feel being vegetarian suits me.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, and getting regular exercise can also be a change for the better! Do you want to know what else would be a change for the better?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sure! What? Less stress? Less work?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No. If you never wear that horrible flamingo costume you wore for Hallowe'en again! That really would be a change for the better for all of us!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, that I can't promise! Sorry!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
