     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目，我是菲菲。

     And I'm Neil. We have a phrase about following other people's thoughts, ideas or actions because it's the easiest thing to do. It's 'go with the flow'.
    </p>

     <strong>

     Go with the flow. 它的意思是 “随波逐流”。那么，“go with the flow” 怎么用呢？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, when someone's ideas, thoughts or actions start developing, we can think of them as moving along, and when you 'go with the flow', you just move along with it, you don't resist, you go with it!
    </p>
    <p>

     I see. 在日常对话中，当我们想表达 “随大溜” 的时候，就可以用 “go with the flow”。Like the other day when we were all arranging to go out for dinner, Rob suggested going to the cafe near the office. I wasn't that keen, but rather than making a fuss, I went with the flow. 我其实并不是很想去，但是与其站出来反对 Rob 的提议，我决定随大溜。I went with the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ha! You did – but that's easier than trying to argue with Rob! Going with the flow is about being relaxed and accepting the situation. Here are some more examples of 'go with the flow'.
    </p>

      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I thought my ideas for the new project were better, but I decided to keep quiet and go with the flow!
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though he couldn't agree with our tactics, I told Tom to go with the flow if he wants us to win the match.
    </p>
    <p>
     A: Where shall we go out to eat tonight?
     <br/>
     B: I don't mind, I'll go with the flow.
    </p>

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们介绍了表达 “go with the flow” 的意思和用法，它表示 “随大溜；不反对、不抵抗，顺其自然”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. It's not about compromising or negotiation – it's just about accepting things. A similar expression is 'go with the tide'. Sometimes Feifei, it's just easier to go with the flow.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You mean like accepting Rob's idea of going to the restaurant tonight?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, exactly. So come on, it's time to go there now.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, it's not! I said six o'clock. I've got too much work to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, Feifei, just go with the flow and come now. I'll treat you.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     In that case, Neil, let's go! Bye.
    </p>

     <br/>
     Bye.
