     And me, Neil. We're going to teach an informal expression which means 'to accept the loss of an opportunity or loss of something': it's 'kiss something goodbye'.
    </p>

     Kiss something goodbye. When did you have to kiss something goodbye, Neil?
    </p>

     I once left my phone on the train. I asked the company if they'd found it, but they hadn't. I had to kiss my phone goodbye.
    </p>

     Ah… 有一回，你把手机落在了火车上，后来也没能找到。所以，你只好接受手机再也找不到的事实，告诉自己甭想找到它了。You had to kiss your phone goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     <br/>
     Yes. I also recently tried to get a promotion at work – but I didn't do very well in the interview. In the end, I had to kiss the opportunity goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>

     Well, hopefully, you'll do better in the next interview.

     Thanks. I'll prepare more next time. Let's hear some more examples.

     Sadly, the business hasn't made a profit for three years. We're going to have to kiss the company goodbye.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上，我们介绍了表达 “kiss something goodbye” 的用法，它的字面意思是 “与某事吻别”，实际意思是 “接受已失去某物的事实，与之说再见”。注意这是一个非正式表达。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. It is very informal – and is often used to highlight that the person has accepted that a thing or situation is gone forever.
    </p>
    <p>

     你失去的东西或错过的机会通常是一去不复返。Can you also use it for people?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, but this would probably be more literal, in the sense that you might kiss someone you love when you're saying goodbye to them.
    </p>
    <p>
