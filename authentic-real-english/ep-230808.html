     … and I'm Rob. We're going to look at an idiom that's about the possibility of winning – it's 'be in with a shout'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Be in with a shout. 虽然名词 “shout” 指 “喊叫”，但习语 “be in with a shout” 的意思并不是 “大喊大叫”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's not. 'To be in with a shout' means to have a good chance of winning something or succeeding in something. And there's no need to shout if you want to win!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
      <br/>
     </strong>
     没错，“be in with a shout” 是一句非正式的英式习语，它表示 “有望获胜或成功”。举一个和体育运动有关的例子，我最喜欢的足球队在联赛中排名第二，如果他们再多进几个球，就 “有望取胜”。They're in with a shout.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm… But only if there is a realistic chance or probability that they will do it. And this idiom is not just used for sport. It's for any situation in which winning something is a possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK. 再举一个例子，我要参加一场升职面试，如果一切顺利，我就 “有望晋升”。I'm in with a shout if the interview goes well.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Good luck with that! Let's hear some more examples of this idiom, shall we?
    </p>

      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     According to your teachers, you could be in with a shout of getting top grades in all your exams.
    </p>
    <p>
     The athlete was in with a shout of winning a gold medal, until he tripped over at the last minute and only came third.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think we're in with a shout of raising enough money to build the new children's playground.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们介绍了习语 “be in with a shout” 的含义和用法，它的意思是 “有望、有机会获胜或成功”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

      <br/>

     Yes, as I say, it's when there is a good chance you will win. If it's unlikely you're going to achieve something, then we don't use it. I would like to climb to the top of Mount Everest – but let's be honest, I'm not in with a shout of doing that!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
      <br/>
     </strong>
     True. 对了，我刚买了一张彩票，我觉得 “我很有可能中奖，成为百万富翁”。I'm in with a shout of becoming a millionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I don't think buying one lottery ticket means there's a good chance of winning millions of pounds – sorry. But hopefully you're in with a shout of getting a promotion and maybe more money!
    </p>
    <p>
