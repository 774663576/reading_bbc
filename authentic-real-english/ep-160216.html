     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 《地道英语》节目，我是 Helen，和我在一起的还有我的同事 Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hello. Hey Helen, have you heard NeiI's good news?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, what's that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He ran in the London Marathon and he came first!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil 参加伦敦马拉松赛，还拿了第一名？这怎么可能呢？That's impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well I know it's hard to believe but he has been training very hard and he is quite a fast runner.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry Rob – he's lying through his teeth – he went to the cinema on Sunday!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh did he really? Well, you've just used a perfect phrase – 'to lie through your teeth' – it means to tell someone something that's completely untrue.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's why I said it! 成语 to lie through your teeth, 字面的意思是“从牙缝里说谎言”，也就是我们中文里常说的“睁眼说瞎话”。Neil 可不是忽悠你嘛，so he's giving you false information.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I'm going to have words with him – but before I do, let's hear some more examples of this phrase…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     When she said she was nearly 30 years old, I knew she was lying through her teeth!
    </p>
    <p>
     They promised we'd get free drinks every day at our hotel but they were lying through their teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     He lied through his teeth when he said he bought her an expensive engagement ring – it was just a cheap one from the catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil 就是瞎掰，他压根没去跑马拉松，星期天他去看电影了。Neil was telling an outrageous lie, I can't believe you fell for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well actually, it was me who was lying through my teeth. Neil didn't tell me he'd won the marathon – it was a trick to find out where Neil really was on Sunday – and now you've told me – he was alone at the cinema! Thanks very much.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, to be honest, he wasn't alone at the cinema – he went with me but we forgot to invite you. 不好意思，其实我也去了。本来我们也想约你一起去的，不小心给忘了。I'm sorry!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You liar!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It was just a little white lie - 真的，我说的是“善意的谎言”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A what?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A little white lie – a lie that's told just to avoid upsetting someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well it hasn't worked. I'm off. Good bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Helen
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh dear, Rob.
