     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或者短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm here with Beth.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hi everyone. How are you today, Feifei?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'm OK, but the weather is miserable! Nonstop rain.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I know. I hate it too. But, on the flip side, we're inside so we can't actually get wet, and at least it's warm!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It is. And, 'the flip side' is the expression we're learning in this programme. The flip side means the opposite or another side of something, like showing both pros and cons.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. The flip side is a way of introducing the opposite perspective of something. So, you said it's raining, but I turned it around and said 'we're inside, so at least we're warm'. Think of it like turning something over to reveal the other side, like a coin.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, I could say I spent the whole Sunday cooking this one dish, and the kitchen was a mess and I was exhausted.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh dear. But, on the flip side, at least you tried a new recipe, and you've got some good food?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yeah, I suppose.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yeah. And I could say that 'I've been working from home a lot recently, and I don't really like it. I prefer being in the office.'
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And I could say 'on the flip side, Beth, you don't have to travel on crowded trains.'
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That is very true, yes. Well, here are some more examples of the expression 'the flip side'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I went for my first long run the other day, and it was so nice to get out in the fresh air. But on the flip side, I ended up with really achy muscles.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     Oh, I really don't like this time of year. It gets dark so early, and it's so cold. But on the flip side, I'm catching up on loads of TV series I'd missed out on.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I went to a new beach the other day. It was absolutely beautiful. But on the flip side, it was also really crowded.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们一起学习了短语 “the flip side” 的用法。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     In conversation, this is very often used to try and cheer someone up, especially if they are complaining. So, Feifei, if I said to you 'ergh I've got so much work to do today'…
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Then I could say 'Yes, but on the flip side, we're going out for drinks later'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     短语 “the flip side” 的意思是 “另一面”。在日常对话中，我们可以用 “the flip side” 来引出对某件事情的另一个视角。特别是，我们可以用 “the flip side” 来引出安慰他人的话，或者让人宽心的语句。比如，你的朋友刚买到手机就出故障开不了机了，这时你就可以说 “On the flip side – at least it's still within warranty!”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So, to recap, we've learnt 'the flip side' which means introducing a contrast to change someone's perspective on something.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And that's all from us. We'll be back next time with another useful English phrase. See you then!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
