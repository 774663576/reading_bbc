     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hello and welcome to Authentic Real English. I'm Rob and joining me today is Helen.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hi everyone, I'm Helen. Rob, I hear you have a holiday coming up soon.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh yes, we have booked a trip to China to visit the home of pandas.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Do you mean Chengdu?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, we are stopping there for a few days and then to HK for two weeks.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You know Chengdu is my home town. I grew up there.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, I didn't know that. So you must know the place like the back of your hand then.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     The back of my hand? 我的手背。我的手背还好啊，有点干。不过这和成都有啥关系？
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, it's a very common expression we use to say that we know somewhere very well, or extremely familiar with the place. You hear people say it all the time.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     噢，原来是这个意思，当我们听到 know somewhere like the back of your hand，意思就是对什么地方非常了解就像对自己的手背那么熟悉一样。以下是两个例句：
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     He knows the building like the back of his hand.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     She lived in village all her life, and knows the area like the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     那么除了说对什么地方很了解之外，这个短语可以用于其它语境吗？
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, we can used to describe books and other things we know very well. It's not just limited to places.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     这个表达还可以用于对什么东西比如书、兴趣，非常精通了解。Here are more examples:
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Jenny knows that book like the back of her hand. She has read it at least twenty times.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     Max knows the Bond films like the back of his hand; he could recite the whole script of all of them.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So Helen, since you lived in Chengdu for many years, any recommendations for good places to visit in Chengdu?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Actually, the city has changed so much; I would be lost there like any other visitor. But my cousin still lives there. He definitely knows the city like the back of his hand.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Maybe I should give him a call.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm sure he'll be happy to help.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Great!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Helen
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Have a good trip then.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Thanks.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Both
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye!
