     你的一天是如何开始的？会不会 “feel good from the get-go”，从一大早就有好心情？我们可以用 “from the get-go” 来表达 “某事从一开始就……”。除此之外，“from the beginning” 和 “from the very start” 也可以表达相同的意思。本期节目教你如何使用 “from the get-go”。

     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm here with Beth.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">

     <br/>
     Hi everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     本期节目中我们要学习一个表达, “from the get-go”。我和 Beth 将先用英语为大家讲解它的用法，最后再由我用汉语进行归纳总结。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     So, Beth, we're learning 'from the get-go'. For example, I could say I knew this was a great job for me from the get-go.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, yes! 'From the get-go' means right from the beginning. So, you knew this job was a good fit for you as soon as you started.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I did. And we can use this for anything that has a beginning. For example, I recently went on holiday, and I had a perfect holiday from the get-go.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Great, sounds wonderful. So, I went to the cinema recently, and this film – the opening scene was so funny. And the whole film was just hilarious from the get-go.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You'll have to tell me the name of the film!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I will! But first, here are some more examples of the expression 'from the get-go'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I just have a really good friendship with him. It was obvious when we first met that we were going to get on well from the get-go.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I took a flight the other day, and there was a lot of turbulence from the get-go. It was absolutely terrifying.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I read this book about wizards and elves. I loved it from the get-go.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now, we can also say 'right from the get-go'. When we put 'right' in front of an expression like this, it really emphasises that it was exactly from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. And there are other expressions similar to this one, like 'from the very start' or 'from the very beginning'. And, again, we can add 'right' in front of these expressions to add emphasis. For example, 'right from the very start'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So, to recap, we've learnt the expression 'from the get-go' which means from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     表达 “from the get-go” 的意思是 “从一开始”，它可以用来形容 “某件事情、某个活动或者某个客观条件从它们最初开始的时候就……”。在这个表达中，“get-go” 是一个名词，意思是 “开始，开端”。和 “from the get-go” 意思相似的表达有 “from the beginning”、“from the very start”。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     我们可以在这几个表达前面加上用来强调语气的副词 “right”，比如：“right from the get-go”，意思就是 “从最一开始”。来举一个例子：“I knew that this programme would be quite informative right from the get-go. 本期节目刚一开始我就知道它的信息量可不小。”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">

     </strong>
     That's all from us. We'll be back next week with another useful expression. See you then!
    </p>
