     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm joined by Georgie. Hi Georgie, how are you?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm OK, Feifei… I'm just really struggling to open this jar.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Come on Georgie, give it some welly!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     There we go! Now, Feifei, you used a great expression there – give it some welly! And that's what we're learning in this programme. It's a British English expression used to encourage people to put more effort or force into an activity, usually something physical, like me opening this jar.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, it's an imperative, but it's quite friendly and fun, so don't worry, you won't sound rude if you say it. It can be used in lots of contexts, like cycling up a hill – "Give it some welly!" Or hammering a nail into a very hard wall – "Give it some welly!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's hear some more examples from our BBC Learning English colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I was at karaoke the other day and I was a bit shy at first, but everyone just said "Come on, give it some welly!" so I sang really loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     You're going to have to hit the ball harder than that. Come on, give it some welly!
    </p>
    <p>
     My dad was trying to move the sofa at home and it wouldn't move at all, but I said "give it some welly" and he gave it one last push and it moved into place.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。刚刚我们学习了表达 “give it some welly” 的意思和用法。它的意思是 “用点力，加把劲”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Now, its most common use is as an imperative, to encourage people to put some effort in. Although, you might also hear it used to describe someone putting in some effort. For example, did you hear Beth singing karaoke the other night?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, she really gave it some welly, didn't she? I watched my son the other day trying to push a chair across the room – he really gave it some welly!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's so cute! OK, let's recap. We've learned 'give it some welly', which we use to encourage people to put some more effort or force into an activity.
    </p>

     <strong>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     当某人正在费力地完成一个动作的时候，我们就可以对他说 “Give it some welly! 加把劲呀！” 来给他加油或让他使出更大的力气。同时，这个表达也可以用于描述 “某个人做事的时候非常卖力”。“Give it some welly” 这个表达非常轻松活泼，使用的时候会给人一种友善的感觉，所以我们可以大胆地尝试在不同的场合中使用它。

     Remember to give it some welly if you want to learn English well. Thanks for joining us. Bye!
