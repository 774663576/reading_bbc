     … and I'm Rob. In this programme, we have an expression to use when we want to say something is difficult to achieve – because there are things preventing us from reaching our goal. The expression is 'jump through hoops'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     Jump through hoops. 这个表达用了比喻的修辞方法，而不是说真的要通过 “跳圈” 来达成某个目标。We wouldn't actually jump through a hoop to achieve something, would we?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, we wouldn't. But imagine if we actually did have to jump through hoops – that would be very difficult. And that's the sense of this expression. What we mean is you have to do something difficult to get to the result you want. Furthermore, the effort involved is often unnecessary – the process is made more complicated.
    </p>
    <p>

     没错，我们用 “jump through hoops” 来比喻 “克服重重困难、费尽周折才达成目标”。举个例子，有一回我想办理机票退款，找了航空公司的多个部门才找到负责退款的客服人员。I had to jump through hoops to get to the right person.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm… It can be frustrating, Jiaying. I had to jump through hoops trying to get a loan from the bank – there were forms to fill in, paperwork to find, appointments to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, we're not alone. Listen to these people who had to 'jump through hoops'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I had to jump through hoops to get the shop to fix my new laptop. They claimed I had broken it!
    </p>
    <p>
     I really want to buy a new car, but I've got to jump through hoops to get a loan from the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
     He had to jump through hoops to get you a ticket for the match, so I hope you appreciate it.

    </p>

     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it can be challenging and frustrating – like you trying to get a refund for your airline ticket. Did you succeed?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I did, Rob. I jumped through lots of hoops but got the result I wanted. 我费劲了周折，但终于拿到了退款。How about you? Did you get your loan?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm… sadly not, despite jumping through lots of hoops! But hold on, now you've got your money back from the airline, maybe you could lend me some money?!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, Rob, you'll have to jump through more hoops to get my money – the first one is to make me a cup of tea!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, I see. OK, bye for now.
    </p>
