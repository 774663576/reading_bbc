     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     大家好，欢迎收听《地道英语》。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and hello I'm Rob. So what's this I hear about your new business idea Feifei?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I'm going to make and sell cakes. 我准备开一个蛋糕店。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm, are you sure Feifei?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes I'm sure. Look I've already made this batch of muffins.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Err, are they supposed to be black? Cooking isn't really your speciality is it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     做饭不是我的特长？Rob，你可别太小看我，just you watch, I'm going to be a millionaire selling my homemade cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'm sorry to say Feifei but I think you're going to fall at the first hurdle.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Don't be stupid Rob, I'm not going to be jumping any hurdles – we're not talking about sport – just cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No Feifei – I mean you're going to fail right at the start of what you're trying to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Thanks Rob! 短语 fall at the first hurdle 用来形容在做某事时，一开始就遇阻从而失败，也就是我们常说的“跌倒在第一关”。Rob, you think by cooking these 'black' muffins means I have already failed?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well they are burnt. Let's hear some examples of other people who have fallen at the first hurdle….
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Plans to construct a new motorway will fall at the first hurdle if they can't buy the farmland to build it on.
    </p>
    <p>
     His dream of marrying Julie fell at the first hurdle when he discovered she was already married.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     To fall at the first hurdle 的意思就是“倒在第一关”。Ah, but Rob, why don't you actually taste one of these muffins before you call me a failure?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK here goes. Mmm, actually, not bad Feifei. They're not burnt…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … no, it's actually a layer of crunchy toffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, I'm sorry for doubting you… but you're going to have to sell lots of muffins if you want to be a millionaire.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I know. Perhaps I'll just sell these ones first and see how I get on.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good idea. Just make sure you don't fall at the final hurdle!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     在最后时刻跌倒？You mean fail near the end of what I'm trying to do?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I won't – as long as you don't keep eating my cakes. Hands off!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Both
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
