     </strong>
     大家好！欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。你是 Rob！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And hello, you are Feifei! And Feifei, if you don't mind me saying, you're looking a bit stressed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     我看上去特别紧张？Stressed? 我确实有点儿紧张。因为等会儿我要做一个报告，但我觉得我准备的不够充分。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh relax Feifei. There's nothing to worry about.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Really? Well, I've booked the room, got my laptop ready, printed out the handouts, but there must be something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, you sound very well-organised to be honest so stop worrying. It's only a presentation, everyone will be asleep anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's easy for you to be so calm and relaxed about it – you're not doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh come on Feifei, you know me – I'm always calm and relaxed. You could say I'm a happy-go-lucky kind of guy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Happy-go-lucky? Well I know you're always happy but I'm not sure about lucky!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Happy-go-lucky describes someone who doesn't worry about the future and just accepts what happens. It's not really about luck.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     我懂了。在英语里，happy-go-lucky 这个合成形容词里既有“happy 快乐”，又有“lucky 幸运”，两个词中间还夹着“go”。这么一来，这个合成词就可以用来形容一个人是“开心快活的、无忧无虑的”，就是一个“乐天派”。
    </p>

     <br/>
     Now chill out and listen to these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     My sister is happy-go-lucky: she doesn't worry about a thing, not even exams!
    </p>
    <p>
     I like your happy-go-lucky attitude but you're going to have to make a decision on our wedding date!
    </p>
    <p>
     Jake's so happy-go-lucky he doesn't seem to be worried that he's losing his job. I guess he thinks everything will work out well in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     合成形容词 happy-go-lucky 常用来形容一个对未来无忧无虑，对现实听天由命的人。Rob 说他就是这么样个人。Hey Rob, how's your presentation coming along?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     What presentation?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     The one you're doing next Monday. Don't you remember, the boss said we have to take it in turns to do one?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh yeah, yeah, I remember. Don't worry, it will be fine. What's the worst that can happen?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Are you sure? Have you booked a room, prepared your notes, got your laptop working?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Of course… there's plenty of time to sort that out, isn't there? I'm afraid I've just got to head off now, things to do… bye!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh dear, it looks like his happiness and luck have gone. 我还真不觉得 Rob 是个“happy-go-lucky”的乐天派。大家怎么看呢？下次再见。
