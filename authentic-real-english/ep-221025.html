     Hello and welcome to Authentic Real English. 大家好，我是菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and hello, I'm Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     <br/>
     Do you know who made that awful mess in the kitchen?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It's me! I'm just cooking! I'll clean it up as soon as I'm finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, it looks like a dog's dinner in there!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A dinner for my dog? Don't be silly. I've already cooked for Leia, my dog. This is a meal for the whole BBC Learning English team!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     <br/>
     我刚才说 “It looks like a dog's dinner in there.”，意思是 “厨房里面一团糟”。我们可以用 “a dog's dinner（狗食）” 来比喻 “混乱的状况”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You think the kitchen looks a mess? But I'm only using one pan!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Not that kitchen – the other one! Look at it!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, wow! That really is a dog's dinner. I wonder who made all that mess.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Let's find out while we listen to these examples.

      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He made a dog's dinner of his final project and failed the course.
    </p>
    <p>
     She made a dog's dinner of her hair when she tried to cut it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The room looked like a dog's dinner five minutes after my son arrived.
    </p>

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们可以在日常口语中用 “a dog's dinner” 来比喻 “乱糟糟、混乱的状况”。Neil, did you find out who made all that mess?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, I didn't. You?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, but what's great is that everyone on the BBC Learning English team is working together to clear it up! They're ready to try the meal you're cooking!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Wow, that sounds like a bit of pressure! Hopefully, I didn't make a dog's dinner of the recipe!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     你这个厨艺高手就别谦虚了！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, Leia, my dog, never complains when I cook for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     She's a lucky girl. Bye, Neil!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
