     Welcome to Authentic Real English, with me, Rob.

     Now, here's an idiom you use when you want to say you admire someone because they've done something impressive – it's 'hats off'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hats off. 不过我们在使用这个习语时，并不会真的把帽子摘下来。“Hats off” 是用 “脱帽” 的动作来比喻 “向某人致敬”。It's metaphorical, isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it is. Although the origin of the expression is from when a person would raise their hat to show respect to someone. But don't worry, Jiaying, if you're not wearing a hat, you can still say it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good. So, 'hats off' to you, Rob, for telling us about this phrase. 谢谢你给大家讲了这个表达的用法。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Thanks. And hats off to you, Jiaying – I hear you won a cake-making competition. Impressive – it's not easy to make good cakes. I can't even bake!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Thanks. I might let you try some later. 唉，你刚刚是不是在用表达 “hats off” 向我道贺？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, because it's a great achievement – and I can't even bake! Let's hear some more examples of 'hats off'.
    </p>

      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hats off to you for completing your first marathon – what an achievement!
    </p>
    <p>
     I take my hat off to anyone who works full-time and manages a family as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hats off to my brother for getting top grades in all his exams. I'm proud of you!

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们介绍了表达 “hats off” 的意思和用法。在非正式场合中，“hats off” 用来告诉某人你 “很敬佩此人作出的成就”，意思是 “向某人致敬，表示感谢”。我们还可以用 “hats off” 来向他人道贺，相当于 “congratulations”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now, it's not a new saying, but it still gets used today. And of course, it refers to people, not things. So, we don't say 'hats off to the new computer system'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     But we could say 'hats off to the person who installed the new computer system'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, and when we say 'hats off' to someone, it's probably because they have achieved something that you could never do. Like making an award-winning cake!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, yes. Would you like to try some now?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sounds like a good idea. See you next time!
    </p>

     Bye.
