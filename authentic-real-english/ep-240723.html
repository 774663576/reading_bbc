     内容简介
    </h3>
    <p>
     我们有时想表达一个大家都明白的复杂事情，但不想用英语从头到尾描述一遍，就可以使用表达 “the works”。“The works” 在日常英语对话中的意思是 “整件事情” 或 “整套物品”。和它意思相同的另一个表达是什么呢？听节目，学习 “the works” 的用法。

     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的表达。I'm Feifei and I'm joined by Georgie.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hi Feifei! How are you doing?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm actually feeling really rested after the weekend, Georgie. I treated myself to a spa day with a friend. We spent time in the sauna, had a massage, got our nails done – the works!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Feifei, that sounds so relaxing – I'm so jealous! So, you used the phrase 'the works', which is our expression in this programme. Can you explain why you used it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Sure. So, when I said 'the works', I meant 'everything', or all the possible extras or items you might expect from a situation. You can go to a spa and just relax in the steam room for example, but me? I did all the activities and used all the facilities – the works! We can use 'the works' in lots of different contexts, can't we? Georgie, can you give us another example?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, sure. So, my weekend plan involved a picnic in the park. Lots of people came which meant there was a lot of food to share. We had sandwiches, salad, olives, crisps, sausages, fruit, and even chocolate – the works!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Wow. That sounds like a lot of food. Let's hear some more examples of 'the works' from our BBC Learning English colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     We threw my dad a party for his 70th birthday and it had the works – games, loads of food, we had a band – everything!
    </p>
    <p>
     This car is absolutely filthy. You're going have to vacuum the inside, clean the windows, polish it – the works!
    </p>
    <p>
     I need to relax. So, I booked an all-inclusive holiday. I get access to the pools, breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks – the works!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Wow! So, as we've heard, we can use this in lots of different contexts. But Feifei, in the examples we've heard, 'the works' usually comes on its own at the end of a list, almost like an exclamation. Is it always like that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, that's definitely the most common way of using it, so yes. We do sometimes hear 'with the works' when ordering food. For example, when you go to a restaurant, and you want to order a pizza with all the toppings, you might say 'a large pizza, with the works'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Woah! That sounds very filling. Another similar phrase that people can use in a variety of contexts is 'the whole shebang'. At the picnic at the weekend, we had the whole shebang – I was so full I couldn't eat dinner!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm not surprised! And I did the whole shebang at the spa at the weekend – I felt very pampered.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, let's recap. We've learned 'the works', which means everything – all the extras you might expect in any given situation.
    </p>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     是的，在这期 “地道英语” 节目中，我们介绍了如何用表达 “the works” 来表示 “所有配套的东西，整件事情，整套物品”。和 “the works” 意思相同的另一个表达是 “the whole shebang”。比如，刚才我说：“I did the whole shebang at the spa at the weekend.”，意思就是 “周末我在水疗中心做了全套的水疗”。所以，下次当大家想要表达 “全套，一整套物品” 或 “整个事件” 的时候，而且大家都知道 “一整套” 指的是什么，这时你就可以直接说 “You know, the works.” 或者 “You know, the whole shebang.”。
    </p>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     And that's all from us. We'll be back next time with another useful English phrase. See you then!
