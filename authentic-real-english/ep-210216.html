     欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。大家好，我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And I'm Roy! I hear you're going on holiday next week! I bet you're really excited about a lovely holiday and not having to think about work for a whole week!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I'm going to the beach, but I'll still be working – I'm going on a workation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, right. Well, I feel like I've been on a workation since March to be honest. I haven't been to the office in months.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     你说的是 “work from home（居家办公）”。我说的 “workation” 的意思是 “你可能去某个地方度假，比如海滩，但同时按照常规继续工作”，也就是 “结合工作（work）和度假（vacation）的旅行假期”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, that makes a lot of sense. It's a portmanteau, or combination of two words –'work' and 'vacation'. So, that means you'll be working as normal then?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, of course. Which means that there will be no office parties while I'm away.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm. Right, so I guess that means I should send an email to cancel the office Olympics while we listen to some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     She spent the day working from the hotel bar and at night she visited the local area. She really enjoyed her workation.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm going on workation next week to be closer to nature while I work. Hopefully the internet will be good.
    </p>
    <p>
     My workation didn't go as planned as it rained the whole time I was away. I didn't manage to see or do anything fun.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上，我们给大家介绍了新合成词 “workation” 的意思和用法。“Workation” 由 “work（工作）” 和 “vacation（度假）” 组成，指 “结合度假和工作的假期”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, so you could go somewhere like a beach, skiing resort or tourist area while working. You can even go to another country on your workation if your company permits it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So, you were planning to hold the office Olympic Games while you thought I wasn't working?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, I was only joking. We would never hold any games or parties without you!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, good – because I bring the fun by winning all the games! Right, I'm going to get ready to go on my workation – a week by the beach and I'll need my sunglasses and swimwear. I can't wait to go to Brighton beach!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You're going to Brighton – in the south of the UK – in February? Haha! Well, good luck finding the Sun. You should probably take a coat on your workation.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, Roy. Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
