     大家好，欢迎收听《地道英语》。我是冯菲菲。

     …and hello, I'm Rob. Err, Feifei what are you doing?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">

     I'm making a cake – a chocolate cake - obviously!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Why are you making a chocolate cake?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's Helen's birthday. 我这不是为了给 Helen 庆生做个蛋糕吗。怎么，你有意见？
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, for a start we are in a radio studio not a kitchen. Also, you've only got five minutes before she arrives – and you're putting salt in the cake mix not sugar.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Ooops!

     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's a recipe for disaster!

     “灾难的菜谱 a recipe for disaster”，你说什么呢？ No, look, it's a recipe for a chocolate cake Rob.

     <em>
      That
     </em>
     might be – but a recipe for disaster means a combination of things that will, at some point, go wrong and cause harm, damage or in this case, humiliation – in other words it will end in trouble.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh really? 原来 a recipe for disaster 被用来指一连串事情迟早会出错、惹麻烦、给人带来小不幸或让人出丑。Oh dear, Rob, this wasn't the recipe I wanted to follow!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No. Let's hear some examples of this phrase in action – and we can work out how to limit the damage.
    </p>

     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     My doctor says drinking too much, not exercising enough, and having a stressful job are a recipe for disaster. He says I might die young!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     I'm not looking forward to the party. Having my wife and ex-girlfriend in the same room will be a recipe for disaster!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     Watch out on the road tonight – all that rain followed by freezing temperatures is a recipe for disaster.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     这个表达 a recipe for disaster 也可以理解为由于某人的言行而使事情“后患无穷”。So what problem is my cake making going to cause, Rob?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well can't you see there's cake mix on the table – the cake won't be ready in time – and it'll taste disgusting with all that salt in it.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh calm down – do you want to taste the cake mix?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh go on then…. Mmmm, actually it's not too bad. And there's not much mess. Perhaps it's not a disaster – but maybe we shouldn't give it to Helen. Shall we keep it for later?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Ha ha – it looks like this has been a recipe for success! 成功的秘诀！
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     A what?

     </strong>
     For once Feifei, you might be right! Bye!
