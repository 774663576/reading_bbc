     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Beth. We have a word that means 'shocked' or 'surprised'. It can be when you're scared or when you're excited. And the word is 'shook'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Shook. “Shook” 这个词可以用来表示 “惊慌失措的” 或者 “激动不已的”。But Beth, how do we actually use it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, well. It's commonly seen in the phrase 'I was shook'. And I know this sounds a bit strange because normally 'shook' is used as the past tense of 'shake'. But here it's being used as an adjective, similar to the use of 'shaken'. And it's used for unexpected situations.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     首先，大家要注意，由于 “shook” 是动词 “shake” 的过去式，所以 “shook” 作形容词的这个用法相对特殊。“Shook” 作形容词的用法类似于 “shaken”，用来描述 “一个人因为受到惊吓而感到震惊或感到兴奋”。The other day, I was in a shop, I turned around, and there was a man right behind me. I was shook. I thought I was alone!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That does sound scary. Something similar happened to me. I was here at work, and I could feel that someone was standing right behind me. I turned around and it was a singer I absolutely love! I was like 'I'm shook'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Crazy! 在用 “shook” 形容 “某人惊慌失措的表现” 的时候， 这个人一定是 “因为受到惊吓而感到惊慌失措”。
     <strong>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's right. Let's hear some more examples.
    </p>

      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Look at this pie I made. Isn't it good? I'm shook.
    </p>
    <p>
     I was just falling asleep when I remembered I hadn't done my homework. I was shook.
    </p>
    <p>
     I gave my cat a new toy, and I've never seen her so excited. She was shook.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。刚刚我们听了三个使用了形容词 “shook” 的例句。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now, here in the UK, this word is most commonly said and written by young people, especially teenagers. So, it's very common to see it on social media.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. For example, a video of someone doing a crazy stunt might have hashtag 'shook' with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. Now, I need to go because I need to post something on social media, actually. And when you see it, Feifei, you'll be shook. See you later.
    </p>
    <p>

     Bye!
