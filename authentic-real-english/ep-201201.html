     欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。大家好，我是冯菲菲。
    </p>

     <br/>
     And I'm Roy!

     你这是在干什么？怎么这么多钥匙？ What is that noise?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry, I was just cutting some keys! It turns out that I've been doing my job wrong all these years!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah! I know what happened. Neil called you to say you're not a key worker, right?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Exactly! All this time at the BBC and I hadn't cut a single key! I'm lucky Neil was so forgiving. He had no idea what to say when I told him I'd start cutting keys.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil 听了你的回答，不知道说什么，这一点我不惊讶。因为你理解错了 “a key worker” 的意思。“A key worker” 指的是 “给民众提供必要服务的关键工作人员”，比如，医生和护士。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yep, that's more logical. I get confused sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You do. Let's listen to these examples while you get rid of those keys.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     My friends Jorge and Zdenka are both key workers! They do the amazing job of teaching kids.
    </p>
    <p>
     Michiko is a key worker, but her class is closed at the moment due to the outbreak of the virus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Key workers need to have easy access to their places of work during the coronavirus crisis.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上，我们介绍了表达 “key worker” 的意思和用法。“Key worker” 指的是 “提供必要服务或扮演重要角色的关键工作人员”，比如老师、医生或护士。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's right! 'Key' in this expression relates to 'vital' or 'important'. Not to keys that open locks.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's correct, Roy. And it's been quite a common expression during the coronavirus pandemic. People have been talking about the importance of key workers being able to do their jobs during a world crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's right. In fact, I could say it's been a key point of discussion. I really respect the amazing jobs that people like doctors, nurses, emergency service staff, and teachers do.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, me too. Err, one thing, though, Roy. How much did you spend on that key cutting machine?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Enough to say 'please don't tell my wife – she'll be really angry'. Do you want me to cut you a new key?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No. I don't want to encourage you! Bye, Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
