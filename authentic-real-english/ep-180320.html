     </strong>
     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And I'm Rob. Hello. Errr, Feifei, you're looking a bit angry.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     我怎么能不生气呢？I am angry.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh no, what's the problem?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I think you know Rob. Somebody told the boss that I spilt coffee over his computer yesterday – and now he's angry with me.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh no. What kind of mean and horrible person would try and get you into trouble?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     说的就是啊，到底是谁给我栽赃？You and the boss were the only people left in the office last night. Hmmm?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Whoa – hold on Feifei. If you are implying it was me who told the boss, then you are barking up the wrong tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Please don't make me any angrier by saying that I am like a dog!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No, no Feifei. Just calm down, I should be angry because you are making the wrong assumption about who told the boss, ok? That's what I mean by barking up the wrong tree – you want to blame someone but you got the wrong person. I didn't even know you’d done it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, I'm sorry. 原来英国人在对话中用表达“barking up the wrong tree喊错了树”来描述一个人在寻找一件事的缘由时，找错了原因，攻击错了对象。我想知道是谁告诉老板我把咖啡洒在他的电脑上，但我错怪了 Rob，所以我“barked up the wrong tree”。 Shall we listen to some examples while I make you a coffee to say sorry?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     If you think I have enough spare cash to pay for your holiday, then you're barking up the wrong tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     You're barking up the wrong tree if you think I was the one who said you were leaving. It wasn't me!
    </p>
    <p>
     You're barking up the wrong tree if you think I'm going to lend you my car. I've seen how you drive!
    </p>

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。在这集节目里，我们正在一起学习表达“barking up the wrong tree”。它被用来指一个人捕风捉影，找错了对象，错怪了别人。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     The phrase can also mean 'doing something in a way that will not work' – you're basically wasting your time. Like a detective trying to solve a crime by obviously arresting the wrong man – he's barking up the wrong tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK Rob, understood. Here's your coffee to say sorry for barking up the wrong tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Thanks – make sure you don't spill it this time - the boss would be really angry! Oh, what did I say?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If I find out you did tell the boss, I'll make sure to bark up the right tree, ok?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK Feifei, I hope your bark is worse than your bite. Bye-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye.
