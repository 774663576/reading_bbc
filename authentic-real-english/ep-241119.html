     Now, I should be telling you that you shouldn't eat in the studio – but that looks delicious. Where did you get the recipe for that?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     I didn't – I just made it up on the fly. I started cooking and then looked to see what was in the fridge. It's a bit random, but it turned out alright. Do you want to try some?
    </p>
    <p>

     Oh, thanks! And also, thank you for giving us a phrase to learn in this episode – 'on the fly'. It means that you decide what to do, as you are doing it. So, you do something quickly, without any preparation, improvising as you go along.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, I was talking about making food – but it could be anything. If we didn't have a script for this programme we could just come in and make it up on the fly.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>

     If you are very good at something, then you can do it on the fly. For example, a simultaneous interpreter can come up with translations of what people are saying on the fly.
    </p>

     Let's hear some more examples of people using 'on the fly'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I've got a job interview, and I haven't prepared. So, I think I'm going to have to make my answers up on the fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, I'm supposed to be going on this backpacking trip tomorrow with a friend, but we haven't planned anything. So, we are just going to make it up on the fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't feel like this presentation is good at all – we just did it on the fly. We should have prepared more.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。刚刚我们讲了 “on the fly” 这个习惯用语的意思。它用来指 “某人未经准备做某事，临场发挥、边想边做”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. And, for example, I was going to give a talk on how to use the present perfect continuous, and I didn't plan it. But, because I know it quite well I could just do it on the fly.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, 'On the fly' also has some specific uses when talking about computers or cars. In these cases, it refers to things that can be done without interrupting the car or the computer programme.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     Interesting. “On the fly” 还可以用来表示 “计算机或者车辆在运行时可以同时完成其他任务，而不影响已经在运行的功能”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, I can't think of anything more to say on the fly, so let's end there. Bye!
    </p>
