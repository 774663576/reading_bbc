     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And hello, I'm Neil. And I have to say, Feifei, that's a very cool but warm woolly hat you're wearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, thanks, Neil. 能得到你的赞美确实难得啊！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You're welcome. But why are you wearing it in the studio?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, it's so cold outside. I had to wear something to keep my head warm. I suppose I should take it off now?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Err, actually no. Could you pull it down a bit more, so it covers your eyes?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, if you say so. There. How do I look?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Beautiful! And it demonstrates this English phrase perfectly – to pull the wool over your eyes.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Another strange English phrase! So, does it mean 'not being able to see' or maybe, 'to have a very warm head'?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No. To pull the wool over somebody's eyes means to trick or deceive them so that it stops them discovering something.

     短语 “to pull the wool over someone’s eyes 用羊毛蒙住某人的眼睛” 这个表达生动地描述了故意蒙骗他人的行为。But Neil, you don't actually have to wear a woolly hat to do this?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You don't. But for now, keep the hat where it is while we hear some examples.
    </p>

      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You can't pull the wool over my eyes. I know you've been smoking. I can smell it!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     He tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the shareholders and not tell them the company was bankrupt. But they soon found out.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     You can't pull the wool over her eyes. She's too smart. She'll find out you've been dating her best friend.

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》。这集节目中介绍的表达是 “to pull the wool over someone’s eyes”。它的意思是 “蒙骗、欺骗他人”。So, it's really about hiding something from someone?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Exactly!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So are you pulling the wool over my eyes? Neil? Are you there?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Of course not. Ha ha! She will never know. I've taken the biscuits from her handbag. OK, Feifei. You can remove your hat now. Sorry, it was just funny looking at you like that!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Funny? Pulling the wool over my eyes is no joke. I know you stole my biscuits. You'll pay for this.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, no. Time to go. Bye.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei

     <br/>
     Neil, come back!
