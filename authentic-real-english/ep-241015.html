     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm joined by Georgie.
    </p>

     <strong>
      Georgie
     </strong>
     <strong>
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hi everyone. Feifei, how's your day going?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Not too bad, thank you! What about you?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, actually… not great. I was taking out the bins this morning and there were maggots everywhere! It was disgusting – it made my skin crawl.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     EURGHH! Georgie, you just said the maggots 'made your skin crawl'. And that's the expression we're learning in this programme. But, what does it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, well I'm sure our listeners know what skin is, but Feifei, what does 'crawl' mean?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, 'crawl' is a verb and it's a way of moving your body along the ground. For example, babies crawl on their hands and knees. And animals can crawl too – and it can be quite a creepy movement when they do so.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's right! So, we even have a nickname for bugs which is 'creepy crawlies'. And if something makes our skin crawl, it means you have the sensation of horrible insects crawling over your body – that doesn't sound very nice, does it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No, it doesn't… So, if something makes your skin crawl, it means you're incredibly disgusted or frightened by it. Let's hear some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I watched a film about an alien that attacked a group of people on a spaceship. The alien made my skin crawl.
    </p>
    <p>
     My brother changes his bedsheets about three times a year. It makes my skin crawl just thinking about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     I saw a news story about a plague of mice. There were thousands of them running through people's houses. And it… it just made my skin crawl to see it.
    </p>
    <p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们听了三个使用了 “make my skin crawl” 的例句。
    </p>
    <p>
     Georgie, what kind of reaction did you have when you found those maggots this morning?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh… I don't want to think about it. My whole body shuddered and shook. It was like my skin was physically crawling!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, to remember this expression, you can either think about insects crawling over your skin, or that your skin itself crawls.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     表达 “make my skin crawl” 的意思接近中文表达里的 “让人起鸡皮疙瘩” 或者 “令人头皮发麻”，它用来形容 “某件事情或某种感觉让人非常不舒服、恶心或恐惧，就好像皮肤上有东西在爬的感觉”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. And, join us again next time for another useful English expression. Bye!
    </p>

     Bye-bye!
