     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的表达。I'm Feifei.

     这期节目中要介绍的表达是 “second nature”。首先，我和 Beth 将用英语来讲解 “second nature” 的用法，在节目最后，我会用汉语进行归纳总结。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     Right, Beth. I heard someone use 'second nature' at work recently talking with a new colleague. He said that although recording programmes like this looks complicated, it quickly becomes second nature.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, second nature. That is a great expression! So, when something is second nature, it is so familiar to you that you can do it really easily without having to think about it.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>

     I have a good example for this. I had to learn how to use a computer and a mobile phone, because when I was a child, they didn't exist. However, for my son, using technology like this will be second nature. He's grown up with it.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And now, for you, using technology is second nature as well! For your son, he hasn't known life without a computer and mobile phone, so it's really easy and obvious for him. Now, normally when we use this phrase 'second nature', we start with the thing that is second nature.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, that's right. For example, using technology is second nature for my son. Beth, what is second nature to you?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Umm… I would say driving a car. So, I learnt how to drive when I was 17, and I'm much older than 17 now. So, I've been driving a car for many years. I don't really need to think about it. And I just do it, it's second nature.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That does make you a very experienced driver!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now, here are some more examples of the expression 'second nature'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     The first thing I do every morning when I wake up is make a cup of coffee. I don't even think about it, it's just become second nature.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I'm an absolutely terrible cook, but my mum is so good at cooking. It's just second nature to her.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     When I first started my job, I always lost my way in the building, but now it just feels like second nature to me. I know where I need to go!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now, we can also use 'second nature' to describe a characteristic or a habit that a person has. And this is something personal to the person. So, to give you an example, my dad is very tidy and organised, and that is just second nature to him. He automatically tidies up without having to think about it, unlike me.
     <strong>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Your dad is very organised. So, that's second nature to him. So, 'second nature' can be used for anything you do, like using technology or driving a car, but it can also be a characteristic. For example, neatness is second nature to your dad.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's right. So, to recap, we have learnt the phrase 'second nature' which means we do something easily, without thinking about it.
    </p>

     在这期节目中，我们介绍了表达 “second nature” 的用法，“second nature” 的意思是 “第二天性，习性”。比如，我们可以说 “something is second nature to you” 或者 “something comes as second nature to you”，意思就是 “你可以轻而易举、不费吹灰之力地做一件事情，就好像是天性使然或出于本能一样”。“Second nature” 还可以用来指 “一个人特有的性格特点或者行为习惯”。What is something that is 'second nature' to you? Make your sentence using this phrase. And we'll be back next week with another useful English phrase. See you next time!
