     大家好！欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目，我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     …and me, Roy. Feifei, did you get me a drink of water?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, I did not! Go and get yourself one!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     But I thought you were bringing me one because I overheard you saying to Neil that I was really thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, right! Sorry. You weren't meant to hear that. 我刚才说你 “You are thirsty on social media.” 你总是不断地发自己的照片，试图获得其他人的关注和赞美。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I most certainly am not. What makes you think that I post on social media just to get attention?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I have seen some of your elaborate and ridiculous photos! You posted one the other day with a big rat and another where you were dressed as a superhero!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I didn't do that to get attention. I'm not thirsty! And it wasn't a big rat. It was my dog!
     <strong>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Right… let’s listen to some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Geoff said Sandra's photos were attention seeking. I told him she's thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stop being so thirsty! Why do you always have to post photos just to get attention?
    </p>
    <p>
     Vladimir is so thirsty. He's always sharing photos of himself and a puppy – just to get likes!
    </p>
    <p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在我们刚刚听到的例句中，形容词 “thirsty” 都被用来形容那些非常想引起关注和得到赞扬的人。
     <strong>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I must admit - a lot of people on social media seem really thirsty. They're always posting photos to get likes. You can also say that someone is 'fishing for compliments'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Or 'attention seeking'! That's another way of saying 'thirsty'. Which reminds me – you look really hot. Do you still want that drink of water?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, please! I'm really thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Ah, got you! I recorded you admitting that you're really thirsty. Next time you post something, I have proof.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     But I only wanted a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Get it yourself! Bye, Roy!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, bye.
