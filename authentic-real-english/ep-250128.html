     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或者短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm joined by Beth.
    </p>

     Hi Feifei. How are you?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei

     </strong>
     I'm very well, thank you, Beth. I've actually got a question for you, Beth. Have you been watching that new TV drama everyone's talking about?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I love it. There are two characters, Becky and Max, and I really want them to get together. I ship them so much.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">

     'Ship'. Such a great word, isn't it? And it's what we're looking at in this programme. In the world of fandoms, 'to ship' means you want two people, usually fictional characters, to be in a relationship. Of course, 'ship' is short for the word 'relationship'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Exactly. It's a popular word among fans of TV shows, movies and books. I've seen lots of people on social media talking about how they ship characters, meaning they want the characters to end up together.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. And after the verb 'ship', we add people's names. For example, when I was reading 'Pride and Prejudice', I really shipped Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, and they got together in the end! I was so happy.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, so nice. But 'ship' is not just used for fictional couples. You can even use it playfully to talk about real people. So, I have two friends who always hang out, and they're both single, and I hope they get together – I really ship them.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei

     </strong>
     Let's hear some more examples of the word 'ship'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So, there are these two people who I see on my bus every day, and they don't know each other, but I ship them. They're made for each other.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I watch the breakfast news every morning, and there are two presenters on there. I don't think there's anything going on, but they're so cute together. I totally ship them.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     So, I've just read this book, and the two main characters got together at the end, but I shipped them from the beginning. I knew they were going to get together.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们一起学习了俗语 “ship” 的用法。“Ship” 是由单词 “relationship（关系）” 演变而来的，它可以作动词，意思是 “希望两个虚构人物或现实中的人能够成为一对伴侣”。这个词常常在社交媒体上被用于表达 “自己想要撮合两个人”。比如，“I ship Jack and Rose” 的意思就是 “我希望杰克和罗斯能走到一起”。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And fans even create 'ship names' by combining character names. For example, Becky and Max, hmm, they could be… 'Bax'!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm…“Ship” 还可以用作名词，意思就是 “许多人认可或赞同的一对情侣”。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So, it's a way for fans to be enthusiastic and creative together.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">

      <br/>
     </strong>
     Indeed. And that's all from us. We'll be back next time with another useful English phrase. See you then.
