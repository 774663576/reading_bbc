     大家好。欢迎收听BBC英语教学节目《地道英语》。今天我的搭档是Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hello everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Neil, you're looking very happy today, what are you up to?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm quite excited about my website: greatmindsshakehands.com. I've been designing it for months and it's nearly completed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     真的？我不知道你还会设计网页呢。Wow, I like the sound of it. I didn't know you could design websites, Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, it's for fun really. My website will be a public site where people can share ideas, you know like-minded people. I want to launch it next week but first I must test the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Test the water？ 你要测试水？难道你的网页还需要水吗？ Does your website depend on water? I'm very confused!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No Li, to test the water means to test the idea, try it out and see if it works.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh I see. 'Test the water' 就是探测，摸底，看看别人有什么反应。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's right. 'Test the water' is the phrase for Authentic Real English today. Let's hear some examples of how people use it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Woman A: Have you started on your new book?
     <br/>
     Woman B: Yes, I've written three chapters and I've sent it to the publishers to test the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Woman A: Oh, what perfume are you wearing? It's lovely.
     <br/>
     Woman B: Oh thanks. It's just a sample a company sent me.  They're testing the water to see if people like it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Woman A: How is your Shakespeare project going?
     <br/>
     Woman B: It's early days; we're still testing the water.
     <br/>
     Woman A: Well, good luck with it.
     <br/>
     Woman B: Thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So Neil, how much testing have you done, have you got good feedback? 摸底的结果如何？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, my wife loves it, but most other people say they don't understand how to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It sounds like it's not user-friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You're right. I think, I need to make a few changes and then I'll test the water again.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     如果需要我也可以充当你的摸底对象哦。I'm happy to be your guinea pig when you're ready.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     A 'guinea pig', I think that's an expression for another programme. For now, it's goodbye from both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Goodbye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Goodbye.
