    <p>
     虽然有时在生活、工作或学习中犯小错误在所难免，但我们仍会因犯错误而感到自责。英语中有一个表达可以用来安慰他人 “谁都难免会犯这种错误，不要过于纠结，要向前看”。本期节目就来介绍这个实用表达的含义和用法。

     Sometimes when someone makes a mistake, we need to let them know that 'everyone makes mistakes, and they should try not to worry about it too much' – the expression we say is 'it happens to the best of us'.
    </p>
    <p>

     It happens to the best of us. Neil，给我们举几个例子吧？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sure. Yesterday, my friend told me that he missed a deadline at work. He felt terrible about it, but I said, "Don't worry, it happens to the best of us."
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei

     <br/>
     It happens to the best of us. 这种事情大家都会碰到，在所难免。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     <br/>
     Here's another example. I went to a castle near where I live. At one point, my wife said that I should take a photo of it, but I had forgotten to bring my phone. I'd left it at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It happens to the best of us. 人人都难免会遇到这种事情。我自己也有过不小心把东西落在家里的经历。
    </p>
    <p>

     Let's hear some more examples.

      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     During the speech, the CEO completely forgot what he was saying. It happens to the best of us.
    </p>
    <p>
     My daughter failed her driving test, and she was really upset. I told her it happens to the best of us.
    </p>
    <p>
     My friend missed his train because he overslept. It happens to the best of us.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们介绍了表达 “it happens to the best of us” 的含义和用法。当我们想要安慰他人不要为自己犯下的错误感到太难过、太纠结的时候，就可以用 “it happens to the best of us”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it's a common way to make someone feel better who's made a mistake and feels bad about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     没错，通常我们用 “it happens to the best of us” 来劝他人 “别太纠结于错误本身，要向前看”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, and sometimes we say 'it can happen to the best of us', using the verb 'can'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, we've run out of time – but that can happen to the best of us, can't it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It can. Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye!
