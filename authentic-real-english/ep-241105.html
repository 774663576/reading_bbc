     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或者短语。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Beth. Hi everyone.

     本期节目中我们要学习一个习语，“warts and all”。And Beth, this is an idiom which I heard on a podcast about an autobiography. An actress I like has written about her life – “warts and all”, she said.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, yes! 'Warts and all' – it means that we talk about a person or a thing exactly as it is, including flaws and imperfections. And the person doesn't have to actually have a real wart!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No! A wart is lump on the skin. So, this actress had some problems a few years ago, and she included all the details about that. So, when you talk about difficult or unpleasant things, we can say 'warts and all'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, I have an example for this. So recently I was looking through some old photos of me when I was at school, so me and my friends as teenagers, and those photos were definitely not edited. We were there, warts and all.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>

     </strong>
     Beth, I'm sure you looked just fine there.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth

     </strong>
     Here are some more examples of 'warts and all'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I went away for the weekend with my best friend, and we had a really good time, but he does annoy me quite a lot. But that's friendship, isn't it – you've got to accept people warts and all.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I adopted a cat and I love him warts and all – he's a little bit scruffy, he's quite naughty, he claws all my furniture. But, yeah, he's my best little friend.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I've just read this film review – it's one of the most honest I've ever seen. It's a real warts and all review. You know, it says the film is OK but the acting is terrible, the special effects are unrealistic. They don't hold back, really.

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。“Warts and all” 的意思是 “不掩饰缺点；包括所有缺点在内”。单词 “wart” 的意思是 “疣”，在这个习语当中它用来比喻 “各种缺点”。人们常常用 “warts and all” 来表达 “接受或呈现某人或某个事物原本的样子，不对缺点进行修饰”。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now, this is a really helpful phrase for us to think about pronunciation, particularly linking, in English. So, this phrase sounds like one long word even though it's three, 'warts and all'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. When we have words that end in consonant sounds, like 'warts' and 'and', followed by words that begin with vowel sounds, like 'and' and 'all', we link them together so that they sound like one word, 'warts and all'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And it's also common in British English to not say the /d/ on 'and', but this is optional. 'Warts and all' or 'warts and all'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     是的，在发音的时候要注意 “warts and all” 当中的几个连读。“Warts and all.” 英语中以辅音结尾的单词在连接以元音开头的单词时通常会连读。“Warts and all” 的三个单词都是以这种方式连接的，所以要读作 “warts and all”。同时，英式英语中 “and” 这个词当中的 “d – /d/” 也可以不发音，所以可以这么说：“warts and all”。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And that's it from us. We'll be back next time with another useful English phrase. See you then!
    </p>
