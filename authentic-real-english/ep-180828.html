     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     …and hello, I'm Rob. Erm, Feifei, why were you in the cafe with the boss earlier?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Was I?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Come on. I saw you having lunch with the boss. Nobody ever has lunch with him.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     哎呀，刚才和上司吃饭，被 Rob 给看见了，我该找个什么借口呢？OK, I admit it. I was having lunch with the boss. What's wrong with that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, we all know there is promotion in the department on offer – and you are obviously trying to curry favour with the boss so that you get the job. Honestly!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hold on. I can assure you I was not having curry with the boss – it was just a sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Feifei, if you curry favour with someone you are not eating curry. It means you are trying to get someone – the boss – to like you or even give you something. Something like a promotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I was not! But I like the expression.  其实 “curry favour” 这个说法和 “咖喱” 没什么关系。If you curry favour with someone, you are trying to get them to like you or give you something. 也就是说 “一个人讨好、奉承上司、老板、或有权的人”，就是俗话说的 “拍马屁”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK. Let's hear some more examples of people currying favour with someone else.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I know what you're up to! You're trying to curry favour with the manager by telling her what a great job she's doing!
    </p>
    <p>
     The company tried to curry favour with its employees by giving them all a pay rise.
    </p>
    <p>
     He's trying to get free tickets to the gig by currying favour with the tour manager – it won't work!
    </p>
    <p>

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。本集节目中介绍的表达是 “curry favour”，它用来描述一个人讨好有权利的人而从中获取利益。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Another way of saying it is you are trying to 'keep in with' someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     英语里另一个说法 “keep in with someone” 的意思和 “curry favour” 相似，用来描述一个人和他人都搞好关系，友好相处。It's all a bit false, Rob, trying to make someone like you - which is why I was not trying to curry favour with the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You won't get that promotion anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     We were actually talking about you!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh yes?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     He wanted my advice on whether he should give the promotion to you.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     To me! Well, come on then, what did you say?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You'll need to curry favour with me, if you want to know that!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     How about dinner? I know a nice little curry house just round the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye.
