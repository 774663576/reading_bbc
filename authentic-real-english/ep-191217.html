     Neil，所有东西都带齐了吗？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Think so. I’ve got the tickets, most importantly. Would not want to miss this concert!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Let me see. One, two, three… Neil?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There’re only three tickets. You know Dan’s coming too, right?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Really? Oh man. We’re one short!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What to do?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I don't know.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil, it’s OK. I’ll take one for the team. I’m a bit tired anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Are you sure? I could…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Don't worry. I know how much you love this band!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Too kind. Before I head off, let’s explain the phrase Feifei used. To take one for the team is to give something up for the benefit of others – usually for your friends or colleagues, or your sports team, for example.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     <br/>
     因为门票数量不够，所以我放弃了去听演唱会的机会，让别的同事去了。I took one for the team. “Take one for the team” 这个短语的意思就是 “为了集体利益，牺牲个人利益”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And I’m very grateful. Now, listen to these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There wasn’t enough space in the car for all of us, so Johnny took one for the team and walked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Valentyna injured her foot in the first half of the game. She wanted to continue playing, but we decided that someone else should play in the second half to give us the best chance of winning. Valentyna took one for the team.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes you have to take one for the team. Last week, I spent the day clearing out the kitchen while the rest of the family went to the beach.
    </p>

     You're listening to Authentic Real English from BBC Learning English. In this programme, we're looking at the expression 'take one for the team'. Right, I better get going.
    </p>

     Before you go, Neil, I just want to ask something.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     We need someone to do the late shift next week. I was wondering…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Feifei, don’t you worry. I’ll take one for the team.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I knew you would! Thanks, Neil. Now, go and enjoy the show!
    </p>
    <p>

     Bye.
