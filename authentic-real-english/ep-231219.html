     内容简介
    </h3>
    <p>
     在日常交流中，如果你听到了一件让你觉得不合理或不真实的事情，这时你就可以用英语表达 “I don’t buy it.” 来告诉大家 “我可不相信”。相反，“buy a story” 的意思是 “相信某人说的话” 或者 “相信一件事情”。听对话，学习 “I don’t buy it.” 的正确用法。

     And I'm Phil. We have an expression that you can use if you just don't believe someone – it's 'I don't buy it'.

     I don't buy it. 这个表达很有意思。虽然 “I don't buy it.” 里面包含了动词 “buy（购买）”，但它的实际意思是 “我不相信”，和 “买东西” 没有关系。

     No, it's not connected to shopping. Beth told me she can juggle with five balls – and I just don't buy it – I've never seen her practising. It can't be true!

     And you told me you can play the trumpet! But I've never seen or heard you do it – I don't buy it.

     Did I really say that? I'd forgotten. I said the same thing to my brother and he definitely didn't buy it – he knows I have no musical talent at all.

     Clearly. Let's listen to these examples.

     You're saying it was an accident? Sorry, I don't buy it.

    <p>
     She said her broken computer stopped her doing the assignment, but her tutor just didn't buy it.
    </p>
    <p>
     He said he was working late, but I don't buy that story!

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们介绍了如何用表达 “I don't buy it.” 来表示 “我不相信一件事情”。
    </p>

     It's quite informal but you'll hear it a lot in speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     是的，我们多在人们的口头对话中听到这个表达 —— “I don't buy it.” 不过我们也可以用 “buy a story” 来表达 “相信某人说的话” 或者 “相信一件事情”，但这个用法不如它的否定形式 “I don't buy it.” 常用。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Feifei, I did explain why I didn't get you a birthday present, didn't I?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You did, but I don't buy that story. I'll give you until tomorrow to find something! See you then.
    </p>
