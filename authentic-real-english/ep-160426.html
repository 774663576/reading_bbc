     欢迎收听BBC英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是杨莉。今天我的搭档是 Rob。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hello everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Rob, you look worried, what's on your mind? 你是不是有什么心事？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, I'm just concerned about a good friend. He's been asking me for advice about saving money.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Rob 说一个好朋友请他帮忙，提提理财建议。Well that's very kind of you, but does he have a problem?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     He's one of those people who just can't save money. Every time he gets paid he goes out and spends it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I've heard of such people. I'd say that money burns a hole in his pocket. 这在汉语里叫 “让钱烧的”，也就是说有钱不花难受。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's exactly right, money does burn a hole in his pocket. Whenever he has money he has to spend it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's the phrase for Authentic Real English today. Let's hear some examples of how people use it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     A: Why have you never got any money?
     <br/>
     B: Well, I've got a bad habit of spending my money as soon as I get it. Money burns a hole in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     A: I find saving money so difficult. I like to buy the latest gadgets.
     <br/>
     B: The trouble with you is that money burns a hole in your pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I also have a friend who is tempted to spend every penny.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     This phrase can also be used in a slightly different way.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Rob 说这个短语还有另一个意思。Could you explain, please?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, if something unexpected costs a lot of money, you can also say it burns a hole in your pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I see. 这个短语的另一个意思是计划外的一大笔开销。Let's hear an example.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Example
      <br/>
     </strong>
     A: My daughter is getting married next year.
     <br/>
     B: Oh that's fantastic news.
     <br/>
     A: Yes it is. But I think the cost of the wedding will burn a hole in my pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You'd better start saving money now for your daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, that's right. Well, unless, of course, she marries a rich guy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Fingers crossed. You still look worried Rob. Are you thinking about your friend or your daughter?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm thinking about my friend. I think he might need professional help.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Or maybe he needs a girlfriend, someone who can stop him spending. 也许你的朋友需要有一个女朋友帮他攒钱。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I think that will just make him spend even more.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I know, I was only joking. Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye bye.
