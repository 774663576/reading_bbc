     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语”。I'm Feifei.
    </p>

     And I'm Beth. We have an expression that means you're busy and active. It can be positive or negative. It's 'on the go'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     'On the go'. 这个表达很形象地用 “在行动中 on the go” 来描述一个人 “特别忙碌，忙个不停”。这个 “忙” 可能是 “充实的忙碌”，但也可能是 “过于繁忙，压力大”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

      <br/>
     </strong>
     You're always busy, Feifei, and you're looking a bit tired if you don't mind me saying so, but it's no surprise because you are always on the go.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, honestly, it's quite difficult having to balance work, children, and friends. 所以，我总是在忙里忙外，一刻也不停！I'm always on the go!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You need to take a rest! So, 'on the go' means busy, active and not relaxing. It usually means you're trying to do lots of different things during the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Anyway, you're always on the go too! How do you manage it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I just came back from my holiday. I made sure I wasn't on the go at all. I just sat and read my book all day. Let's hear some more examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Calum is away for work again. He's always on the go.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm usually on the go early, so it doesn't matter what time you arrive, even if it's before breakfast!
    </p>
    <p>
     She's so tired. She's always on the go since starting her new job.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们介绍了如何在日常生活中用 “on the go” 来形容一个人是 “特别忙的，忙个不停的”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now, this expression is very commonly used with adverbs of frequency, like 'always', 'usually' and 'never'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     “On the go” 前面通常会加上频率副词，比如 “always”、“usually” 和 “never”。用频率副词可以来说明你 “有多忙”。I'm always on the go during the week because of work, school pickups, and other activities, but at the weekends I'm usually not on the go because that's when I try and relax.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, we can't relax now. There's lots to do. See you next time!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye-bye!
