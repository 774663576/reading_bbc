     内容简介
    </h3>
    <p>
     在谈判或讨论中，一个阻碍达成协议的问题或分歧被称为 “a sticking point”。 听菲菲和 Roy 的对话，为什么一只鹰和一些独角兽糖果是菲菲谈判的症结？

     欢迎收听BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。大家好，我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … and me, Roy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Roy, please, will you sit down? It's really annoying with you always just standing there!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, I refuse to sit down! I haven't sat down for the whole week. I heard you talking about 'a sticking point' the other day, and after you played a joke on me and glued me to the chair, I will not sit down ever again!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     你又搞错了！“A sticking point” 的意思是 “阻碍达成目标或协议的问题或分歧”。I was talking about negotiating my new work contract. I think I should be given 'unicorn truffles' every day as part of the job.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Wait, so a sticking point in your new contract is that you want unicorn truffles?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes! I also asked for an eagle called Clive. But I want unicorn truffles.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's a great idea! I might ask for free unicorn truffles too.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry, Roy. That's only for amazing people like me. Now, sit down and let's listen to these examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Trade tariffs were a sticking point in the negotiations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bob and Ahmed could not agree on the budget. The amount spent on stationery was a real sticking point.
    </p>
    <p>
     The amount of time it would take to build the railway was a sticking point when it came to signing the final agreement.
    </p>

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们刚才为大家介绍了 “sticking point” 的意思。通常，我们用 “sticking point” 来指代谈判或讨论中的阻塞点、分歧点。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'm glad I could sit down. I was getting really tired! Uh! So, have you finally stopped playing your jokes around the office? Am I safe again?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I've stopped! You're safe!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, that's good. Your jokes were a real sticking point in our friendship!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     说到 “sticking point”，我得赶紧去接着谈判我的新合同。I need to get some of those unicorn truffles! And my eagle!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, I love unicorn truffles!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, there are some on the table over there. You could have all of them, but sadly you're stuck to a chair again! I got you again with my prank! Bye, Roy!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No! Don't leave me stuck to a chair again! Feifei? Oh, bye!
