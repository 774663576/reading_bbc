     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。Hi Rob, how are you?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hi Feifei… I'm fine but I just can't understand why you've brought me to a railway station.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Isn't that obvious?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No. And what's that piece of paper you're waving in your hand?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh this? 我手里拿着一张票。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A ticket. Why would you bring me to a railway station and show me a ticket? It's cold and we could be in a warm studio presenting this programme. And anyway, don't you know it's my birthday and we're supposed to be going out to celebrate later?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     我知道是你的生日，你上周告诉我了，你还说要一个“just the ticket”的礼物。这不，我就带你来车站了。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh Feifei – I didn't want a ticket – when I said 'just the ticket' I meant I wanted something that was exactly what I wanted or needed: A camera, a computer game or maybe a nice bottle of whisky.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     啊，原来是这个意思。Just the ticket 这个短语实际要表达的意思是“正是所需要的东西，求之不得的东西”。我觉得可以这样理解帮助我们记忆：比如过年回家“一票难求”，终于买到票后感叹“This is just the ticket！这正是我想要的票！”
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh dear, what a wasted trip Feifei. Now we're here, let's hear some more examples of this phrase 'just the ticket'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh I feel terrible: I've got a cold and my nose is blocked but a drink of hot honey and lemon would be just the ticket to make me feel better.
    </p>
    <p>
     I think a new art gallery will be just the ticket for improving the image of the town and encouraging more people to visit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our car has got seven seats, so it's just the ticket for taking all the kids to football practice every week.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     好了，just the ticket 就是本集节目中介绍给大家的表达。它可以用来表示一件正是某人想要的或需要的物品。OK Rob, so you wanted something for your birthday that was 'just the ticket' – well you're looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You, Feifei?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No Rob. This ticket in my hand - have you actually looked at it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK let me see… Wow! A train ticket to Paris, for me? That's really generous of you. Thanks Feifei! When do we go?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     We? No, it's just one ticket – I couldn't afford two. Now look, the train's about to leave so you had better go. 祝你玩得开心！
    </p>

     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh right. Well I will be off then. See ya.
    </p>

     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye Rob. Phew, two days in the office without Rob – that is just the ticket for me!
