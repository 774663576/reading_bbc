     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲，还有我的搭档 Rob。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hello! Hey, Feifei. Have you heard the news?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Gossip, you mean.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, no, no. It's true! We've been given the day off! So, sorry, I'm not gonna hang around - I'm off to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     今天放假一天，这是谁说的？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil. He said the boss told him that we've all worked so hard we don't have to work today!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm. It sounds like a wind-up to me.“A wind-up” 的意思是 “为开玩笑而制造的谎话，骗局”。I'm sure Neil was joking!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I was joking, Feifei! I wanted to trick you – to see if you'd leave the office and… take the day off.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ha ha, very funny. Well, actually, I have got the day off. So the joke is on you, and it starts now. Goodbye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Feifei, where are you going? Come back and explain what 'the joke is on you' means, please!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, Rob! When 'the joke is on someone', it means the person who has tried to make you look silly has ended up looking silly themselves. 也就是说玩笑反而开到你自己的头上了！The joke has backfired. And now you look silly, Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Umm, point made, Feifei. Here are some more examples of this phrase in action.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Daisy laughed at my 'terrible' dress sense, until she found out I was wearing a designer dress. I guess the joke's on her now!
    </p>
    <p>
     Ha, you thought I'd never beat your time for completing the marathon. But I have, so the joke's on you!
    </p>
    <p>
     I know you were trying to be funny by saying I'd never pass my exam. But now you're the only one who hasn't, so the joke's on you, I'm afraid!
    </p>

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。在这集节目中，我们给大家介绍的这个表达是 “the joke is on someone”。它的意思是一个人开玩笑没成功，反而把玩笑开到自己头上了。换句话说就是，试图嘲笑别人，但最后自己看起来很傻。So this perfectly describes you, Rob – the joke about taking a day off is 'on you'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I was just having a laugh. Uh, but hold on - where is everybody? The office is empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Huh – not another one of your 'jokes'?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, seriously! Oh, look, there's an email. It says 'Due to a power failure the office is out of action. You can all take the day off.' Ha ha, looks like we've all got a day off after all. The joke's on you, Feifei!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, well, enjoy your free time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Uh, fancy going to the beach?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, thanks. Bye, Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I was joking. Bye.
