     大家好，欢迎收听BBC英语教学为你制作的《地道英语》，我是冯菲菲。
    </p>

     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     (singing badly) And me Rob. Hello!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Err Rob, what is that terrible noise?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Noise? This is my best singing voice – I need it for my new job.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Rob, 要辞职去当歌手？You didn't tell me you were leaving the BBC and going to a new job.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm not – I've got a new part-time job in the evenings to earn a bit of extra cash [tries singing again].
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm – and this second job involves singing, does it?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, that's right. I'm going to be a cabaret singer in a nightclub. Good news isn't it?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, Rob, don't give up the day job!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh – that's an expression which means someone's not very good at doing something and isn't likely ever to be successful at doing it.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes – but it's used in a humorous and light-hearted way Rob. 这是一个非正式的幽默表达，意思是要告诉对方应该做好眼下的工作，不要追求不可能成功的事情。Sorry Rob, I was trying to be nice.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm, well, I think we better hear some examples of this phrase in action while I continue to practice my singing (starts singing again).
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh no!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I wouldn't give up the day job - you're never going to be an actor!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     Do you really want to be a writer? I've read your first book and my advice is 'don't give up the day job'!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     Don't give up the day job Pete - you're never going to earn a living as a singer!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     大家都听明白了吧？如果有人对你说 don't give up the day job – 其实就是在婉转地说，你不适合这个新行当，还是保住你眼下的工作，别把业余爱好变成自己的职业。So Rob, have you got the message?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, I should stick to what I'm good at – so I'll concentrate on doing the day job shall I?
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, good idea.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So why we don't we sing together and entertain our listeners then (starts singing)?!
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh Rob, perhaps you should give up the
     <em>
      day
     </em>
     job as well.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh thanks.
    </p>
    <p class="BBCText">
