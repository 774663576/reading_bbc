     什么是 “soft spot 软肋”？菲菲说她知道 Rob 的 “soft spot” 是什么，不过经过一番对话后，菲菲发现 “soft spot” 和人的身体并没有什么关系，而是一种描述你对一件事或一个人的感觉的方式。听他们的对话，学习地道表达 “to have a soft spot for someone or something”。

     大家好，这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh! And hello, I'm Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Rob，你应该知道边吃东西边说话是很不礼貌的吧？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry, sorry! It’s just somebody left these doughnuts here and I had to eat them – I have a soft spot for doughnuts.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     你就不能等一等？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, sorry, I can't. Oh, is that chocolate I can see in your bag? You couldn't spare a few chunks, could you? I have a soft spot for chocolate as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     我的巧克力才不分给你吃呢。But can I assume a 'soft spot' refers to your large and soft belly you have as a result of eating too many sweet things?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     How dare you! Having a soft spot doesn’t mean having a fat belly – not that I have one anyway. If you have a soft spot for something, it means you have the feeling of really liking something or someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Right. 原来，表达 “have a soft spot for someone or something” 的意思是 “十分喜爱某人或某物”。And it's quite a strong feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It is. When you have a soft spot for someone it means you have a lot of affection for them. Is there anyone you have a soft spot for, Feifei?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm. At the moment, I just have a soft spot for some examples!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He always had a soft spot for the woman in accounts – and guess what? Now they're getting married!
    </p>
    <p>
     She has a soft spot for designer shoes. Her cupboard is crammed with hundreds of pairs. Some of them she's never even worn!
    </p>
    <p>
     She's got a soft spot for her English teacher and keeps buying him presents, and she’s always the first to turn up for his lessons.
    </p>
    <p>

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。这集节目中教给大家的地道表达是 “to have a soft spot for someone or something”，它用来指 “对某人或某物特别有好感、亲切感”。So Rob, you asked if I had a soft spot for someone and I do!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, go on.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He's tall and handsome…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh yes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A little beard…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Of course…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And a natural performer.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I knew it! You only had to say, Feifei.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it's the great actor, Scott Foley.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, I see. You have a soft spot for him?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I do. And how about you, Rob?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There's nobody – just doughnuts – soft, round, sweet and squidgy in the middle. What's not to like?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah, just like you then!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ooh, time to go, Feifei. Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye-bye.
