     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或者短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm here with Phil.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hello.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     本期节目中我们要学习表达 “that's on you” 的意思和用法。But first, Phil, why were you so late?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Sorry I'm late but you know, it's not my fault. The traffic was bad – that's completely out of my control.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm sorry, I'm not having that! The traffic is always bad – you should know that. If you're late because you haven't left enough time, well, that's on you, I'm afraid! It's your fault. Do better next time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, so, maybe that was my fault. At least it gives us the phrase to look at for this episode, 'It's on you'. We use 'it's on you' to say 'it's your fault' – and especially as a reminder to someone who doesn't want to admit responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, if someone is having problems because they failed to prepare – then those problems 'are on them', and they should take responsibility. For example, if you come to work at the wrong time because you didn't read your schedule, it's on you. Or, if you fail an exam because you didn't prepare, then that failure is on you.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And, if I'm late again after this, then it's definitely on me! Let's hear some examples of people using 'it's on you'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     If you didn't prepare for your speech, and it went badly, that's on you. It was obviously going to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've already eaten. If you haven't gone shopping and you don't have any food, that's on you.
    </p>
    <p>
     I told you to wear a coat, and you didn't, and now you've got a cold. Well, that's on you.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。“That's on you” 这个表达的意思是 “这就要怪你了”。人们常常用这个表达来指出 “某人应该为某事负起责任”。需要注意，这个表达的语气比较严厉，通常只用于指出 “某人确实有责任做却没有做到的事情”。
    </p>
    <p>
     A different way to use 'on someone' to talk about responsibility is when you offer to pay for something, usually food or drink. You can say 'this is on me' to say that you will pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, if you invite people out for a meal, you can say "Don't worry, this is on me." to say that you will pay for it – that you will take responsibility for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     和 “that's on you” 相似的表达 “that's on me” 可以用来表示 “我来付钱”。它们之间的共同之处是都用 “on someone” 这个搭配来表示 “是某人的责任”。Phil, seeing as you were late today – that's on you. Then, I think the next round of coffees should be on you as well! I hope you've brought your wallet!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I have, yes. See you next time, on time. Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye-bye!
