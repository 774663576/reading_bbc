     Hello, I'm Rob.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     大家好，欢迎收听《地道英语》。我是冯菲菲。Hold on… Rob, are you eating?!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I am. Would you like a crisp? They're cheese and onion flavour.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, go on then – I see you've eaten most of them, but I'll have the last one, shall I?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Actually, Fefei, there weren't many crisps to start with. It's this 'shrinkflation'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm! 现在的薯片包装，一袋里没有几片，Rob 说这都是因为 shrinkflation。Shrinkflation 是 inflation 的反义词，表示“缩水式通货膨胀”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's correct. Inflation is where prices rise or the size of things get bigger, they inflate, like a balloon. But with shrinkflation things get smaller – but not the physical size of things, it's the quantity of something.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     是的，也就是说一包薯片的外包装虽然没有变化，但里面装的薯片和以往比却少了。“缩水式通货膨胀”简称“缩水式通胀”描述事物的数量、分量减少。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. Let's hear some examples of other people using the word 'shrinkflation'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I paid the same price for this chocolate bar as I always have but when I unwrapped it, it was smaller. I guess that's shrinkflation!
    </p>
    <p>
     It appears lots of brands are practising shrinkflation these days, probably to cut costs and maximise their profits.
    </p>
    <p>
     I don't believe it! There used to be 20 biscuits in the packet but now shrinkflation means there are only 16!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     单词 shrinkflation“缩水式通胀”是一个用来描述货物数量减少的经济现象。Why does this happen, Rob?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's a marketing trick. It's so a manufacturer does not put up the price of a product but just reduces the cost of making it by putting less inside. But we think we're getting the same amount.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Shrinkflation 这个经济现象近些年比较常见 – 很多生产商和制造商在面临成本上升时通过“减量不加价”的隐性加价手段希望消费者继续购买他们的产品。That's very clever! It's the same these days with chocolate bars, packets of cereals…

     … and BBC Learning English programmes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     What?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, even this programme is affected by shrinkflation – there's less in it. Even though our listeners might think they're getting the same amount. So, come on, it's time to go.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Really? I think this programme seems to go on for longer than ever.
