     表达 “walk someone through” 的字面意思是 “带某人走过（某处）”，但它的实际意思却和 “walk（走路）” 无关。名词 “walkthrough” 又是什么意思？听节目中的对话，跟主持人 Phil 和菲菲学习如何在工作场景中使用这个表达。

     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Phil. The expression we're teaching in this programme is about showing people how to do things, or explaining something to them. It's 'walk someone through'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     Walk someone through. 表达 “walk someone through” 的字面意思是 “带某人走过某处”，实际意思是 “耐心地给某人指导、解释或一步一步地示范做事的步骤”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, it's most commonly used at work. It means to guide, explain, or practise something step-by-step. So, if there's something new, and you don't know how to do it – you need someone to walk you through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     是的，表达 “walk someone through” 多用于工作场合中。我记得你刚来咱们部门的时候，同事们都为你耐心地示范、讲解做每一项工作的具体步骤。We had to walk you through everything. Luckily, it's all on computers. So, there wasn't much actual walking at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No, it's not really about walking. It's about doing everything slowly and carefully, one step at a time together with someone else. We often use it with different processes. As you were saying, it's very common for when someone starts a new job.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     所以大家不要被 “walk someone through” 这个表达中的单词 “walk” 给迷惑了，这个表达的实际意思和 “walk（走路）” 没有关系。Well, until you walk someone through something, they never really understand it properly. It's good to look at each step in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     True! As well as processes, it can also be used more generally to mean 'explain something carefully'. Listen to these examples.

     We need to produce this report every week. Don't worry, I can walk you through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a lot of information here, but I can walk you through what it all means.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's going to be a really busy event, but I can walk you through what's going to happen.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们介绍了表达 “walk someone through something” 的意思和用法。我们用 “walk someone through something” 来描述 “耐心地给某人讲解、示范应该如何做某事”。

     It's a verb, but there is also a noun that comes from it. We can talk about a 'walkthrough' – that's a practice or a demonstration of something.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     “Walkthrough” 是名词，意思是 “演练，逐步演示”。比如：After you've walked someone through a process, they can do a walkthrough so you can see if they understand it!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, hopefully now we've walked you through how to use 'walk someone through'. Let's stop here.
