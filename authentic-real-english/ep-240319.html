     内容简介
    </h3>
    <p>
     要盖高楼，需要一砖一瓦地垒砌；要做成大事，往往需要从小事做起，一点一滴地积累。英语表达 “brick by brick” 就用来描述 “一步一步地做事”，强调动作仔细、小心。听节目中两位主持人的对话，学习如何在日常生活中使用这个 “地道英语” 表达。

     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Phil. We have a phrase which is about building something up or taking it apart carefully – it's 'brick by brick'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     单词 “brick” 的意思是 “砖”。“Brick by brick” 这个表达和 “construction（建筑）” 有关吗？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It can be, but actually, we often use it more metaphorically, especially when we can use the verb 'build' in that way. So, for example, my brother is really proud of his business. He built it brick by brick.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     明白了。虽然表达 “brick by brick” 可以用来指 “一砖一瓦地盖房子”，但在生活中我们更多地用它的引申含义来比喻 “一步一个脚印地做事” —— “build something brick by brick”。So, your brother's job has nothing to do with building, has it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No, he's an accountant. It's his company that he built. He grew it carefully and gradually and now it's really successful.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, your brother built his success brick by brick! 他一砖一瓦、一步一步地获得了成功。相反，“take something apart brick by brick” 的意思则是 “一步一步小心地拆掉某物”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, that's right. If you take a house apart brick by brick, you're doing it carefully enough that it could be rebuilt somewhere else. Again, it's not just literal – if you're trying to disprove someone, you can take their argument apart brick by brick.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That would be when you carefully argue against each of the points someone has made. 所以，“take something apart brick by brick” 的引申含义就是 “一步一步地拆穿”。比如，我们可以 “take someone's argument apart brick by brick（逐一地反驳某人的观点）”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, that's right. Listen to these examples.
    </p>

     </strong>
     It's nice to be recognised with this award. I've spent years building up my career brick by brick.
    </p>
    <p>
     The historic building was moved brick by brick to the museum.
    </p>
    <p>
     I thought I was well-prepared, but the professor pulled my argument apart brick by brick.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们介绍了表达 “brick by brick” 的含义和用法。“Brick by brick” 本身的意思是 “一砖一瓦、一步一步仔细小心地做事”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     As well as the idea of something done carefully and gradually, it often suggests that something is the result of hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     If someone says that they've built their success brick by brick, they're likely to be proud of the effort that they've made.
    </p>
