     Neil 向菲菲抱怨自己有太多的衣服要洗，但他却说自己只要 “throw in the towel 扔一条毛巾进去”，这让菲菲感到疑惑不解。表达 “throw in the towel” 的意思和 “毛巾” 有什么关系？Neil 用这个短语真正想表达的意思是什么？看视频，学习一个源自拳击运动的地道英语表达。

     大家好，欢迎来到 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。

     And I’m Neil. Hey, do you know what, Feifei? I've had enough!

     你受够了？你受够什么了？

     Trying to do all my washing.

     Really – is it that hard?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It is. I just can't keep up with all the clothes I have to wash, dry and iron. It doesn't matter how much washing I do, I keep running out of clean clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, I can see. Haven't you been wearing that shirt all week?! 那你现在准备怎么办呢？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I don't know. I think I'll just throw in the towel.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     Um…Washing just one towel won't help – you can't wear that to work.
    </p>

     That's not what I meant. 'To throw in the towel' is a saying that means to admit defeat. The phrase comes from boxing. If a boxer is being hit too much, and is losing the fight, sometimes his coach will throw a towel into the boxing ring to signal that the fight is over. He's been defeated.

     Got it! 表达 “to throw in the towel 扔毛巾” 的意思是 “承认失败”。这个说法源自拳击运动，原本指拳击运动员的教练向擂台里扔毛巾以示认输的做法，现在它也用于该运动以外的语境中，比喻 “放弃、认输”。And for you, it means no clean clothes! Let's hear some more examples of this phrase, shall we?

     </strong>
     I've tried my best, but this job is just too hard.  I'm afraid I'm gonna have to throw in the towel and quit.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know the race is tough, but don't throw in the towel, keep going and you might actually win!
    </p>

     I've been trying to learn Korean for years but I'm not making any progress. So I guess it's time to throw in the towel.

     这里是 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目，本集节目中给大家介绍的英语说法是 “throw in the towel”。刚刚 Neil 说洗衣服这件事枯燥无聊，没完没了，所以他用到了 “throw in the towel” 这个搭配，表示放弃，再也不想干了。You can't cope, can you, Neil?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I have tried. There's just too much to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Maybe you've got too many clothes. But if you're not going to wash them, what are you going to wear?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, I've still got my nightclub gear I used to wear as a student – will that do?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm, I think you'd be better off just wearing a towel, Neil!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm, thanks for the fashion advice. I think my best option is to take everything to the launderette.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     这个主意不错！See you!
    </p>

     Goodbye!
