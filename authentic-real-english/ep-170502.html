     在生活中，如果一个观点或意见没有说服力、站不住脚，我们除了可以说“it won’t work”之外，还可以说什么？听节目，学习一个简单而常用的表达。

     Hello, I'm Neil.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     大家好，我是冯菲菲。欢迎收听BBC英语教学的《地道英语》。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     What's in that bag, Feifei?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh this – it's a box of the best washing powder there is – Dazzlebright non-bio washing powder!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And why will I need that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, at the meeting earlier – when John suggested that we all wore suits to work – you said his idea 'won't wash' with the team – so here's some washing powder to help you make it wash.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It's a kind thought – but I won't need it. When I said 'it won't wash' I meant his idea is unconvincing and won't work.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     哦，原来是这个意思。刚才开会的时候约翰提议大家每天都穿西装上班，但尼尔说这个提议“won’t wash”，所以我才拿了 washing powder “洗衣粉”给他。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You see, this phrase originally referred to
     <em>
      fabrics
     </em>
     that were not good quality and wouldn't last long when they were washed. But now it's about someone's
     <em>
      idea
     </em>
     or suggestion not lasting very long because people won't believe it or accept it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     所以现在“it won’t wash”这个说法的意思就是“某事没有说服力，站不住脚”，所以人们不会接受它。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Let's hear some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Your excuses for not finishing your essay won't wash with me – you've missed your deadline and that's that.
    </p>
    <p>
     The boss's idea to work an extra hour everyday won't wash with the team – they'll be furious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just saying you've got a cold won't wash with your fans – they've paid a lot of money to come and see you perform.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     表达“it won’t wash”的意思就是“it won’t work”。一件事情经不起考验，没有说服力，站不住脚，那么我们就可以说“it won’t wash”或“it doesn’t wash”。Neil，其实我知道这个说法的意思。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So why did you bring in the washing powder?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well I know how scruffy our team members are – and if we do have to start wearing suits, they'll all need a good wash. Erm, did you have curry last night?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yeah – why do you ask?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     There's a big yellow stain on your jumper – just there. Here, why not test out use my Dazzlebright washing powder – 'it makes your old clothes look like new!'
