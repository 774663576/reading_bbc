     大家好，欢迎收听《地道英语》。我是冯菲菲…

     … and me Neil. Hello!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Neil, what a nice mobile phone you have with you! Wow! Very flashy! Gold colour!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It's brilliant! The battery lasts a long time. It's got loads of memory, has plenty of room for apps, pictures, videos… The camera is great too!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It must have cost you a fortune!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Not at all, it was a steal!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A steal? 偷来的手机？Neil!!!! Oh, you shouldn't have done that! You are such a nice guy, why would you do something like that? You could have taken out a loan to buy it or something… but…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What do you mean? (Sound of a police car siren)
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     They are here, they've come for you!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, that was just a sound effect! I'm just having a joke with you. I'm not going to be arrested. In English, when you say something is 'a steal' you mean it's a bargain – so cheap that it is almost as if you haven't paid anything for it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     你可真会聊天！原来在英语里，当人们觉得一件东西买得又值又特别便宜的时候就可以说它是个 steal，就好像是白送的 。这是个很口语化的表达，在使用时要注意语境和场合。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry Feifei, it was just a joke. Let's hear examples of how this expression is used.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I got this designer shirt in the sales at £100 cheaper than the original price. It's a steal.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is the latest model, sir. You won't find this new computer cheaper in any other shop in the high street. It's a steal!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     See?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     嗯，现在我完全明白这个词的用法了。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So as I was saying my phone was so cheap… My phone!!! Where is it?! I had it just here! Where has it gone?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yeah, where is it? It was right here…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yeah! Now I really do need to call the police! (Sound of a police car siren)
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, you don't. Your phone is here! I hid it when you got distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Nice one, Feifei. Revenge for my joke at the beginning. And for the listeners - don't steal anything. 'It's a steal' is just an expression.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Both

     <br/>
     Bye!
