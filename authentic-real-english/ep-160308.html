     大家好，我是冯菲菲。欢迎收听BBC英语教学节目《地道英语》。我的搭档是Rob。

     Hello everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hey Rob, did you enjoy Jane and Tim's wedding yesterday?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, it was good wasn't it – especially the party afterwards – all that dancing and drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I did notice! I'm really happy for them but I do hope that Jane will help Tim change his bad habits – Tim是个杂乱无章、健忘而且总是迟到的人！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I don't think he'll change – a leopard doesn't change its spots.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     豹子不会改变它身上的斑点？I think I know that Rob, but what has a leopard got to do with Tim?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Quite a lot, Feifei. The phrase – a leopard doesn't change its spots OR a leopard can't change its spots – means he won't change. He will always be the same person and his bad habits are here to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh I see. 短语 'a leopard doesn't change its spots' 用来比喻一个人难以改变其固有的坏习惯。这相当于汉语里的“江山易改，本性难移”。So Rob, you are comparing a leopard who can never change its spotty appearance with someone who will never change the way they behave?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You've got it, Feifei. Let's hear some examples of how people use the phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I told Karen she had to study more if she wants to pass her exams but a leopard can't change its spots – she won't do it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Freddie promised he wouldn't get into trouble at school but I don't believe him – a leopard can't change its spots.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A leopard can't change its spots - 江山易改，本性难移。So Rob, you don't think Jane will be able to change Tim?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No – he's stubborn – maybe he's going to have to change Jane – she is very neat and tidy and always turns up on time – maybe he could teach her to relax more – chill out.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmmm – 让 Tim 教 Jane 学得更放松一些？我觉得不太可能。Rob, could we say a tiger never changes its stripes – 可不可以说老虎身上的条纹不会改变呢？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ha, very good Feifei, yes we could say that – and it would mean the same thing – she won't change. Oh dear, I'm not sure if their marriage is going to last!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No…or maybe it will. You know what they say? Opposites attract! 这叫异样相吸，不同性格互补。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes Feifei, you're right. Bye for now.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
