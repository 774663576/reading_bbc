     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     大家好，欢迎收听《地道英语》，我是杨莉...
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     And me Rob. So Li, here we are, shopping again... what is it you're going to buy today?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Me? No, I thought you wanted to buy something - you said to me this morning 'give me credit' - so here we are, all my credit cards, including my gold one - impressive hey?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. But Li, I didn't actually mean...
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     (Interrupts) ... So I'll buy something on my credit card and you can pay me back later - Rob 说他需要 credit，所以我就提出让他用我的信用卡来买他的东西，日后他可以把钱还给我就行了 - that's 'giving you credit' - right?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Err, wrong Li. Although it's a nice idea - 'to give me credit' means give me praise or appreciation for something I've done. And this morning I walked the dog, washed the car, did the shopping, and I still got to work at 9 o'clock - so please - give me credit!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I see. 原来，这里的 credit 和信用卡没关系，它的意思是“功劳”，那么 give me credit 可以翻译为“认可或给一些赞扬和称许”，因为我的做了那么多好事。Let's hear some more examples of this phrase...
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      We must give credit to our sponsors who helped pay for this new building.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li>
      I'll give her credit for her beautiful handwriting, but the answers she gave in the test were all wrong!
     </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Give me credit - I worked all night to get the project finished!
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     现 在我明白了 to give someone credit 就是“称赞表扬”。I get the word 'credit' now Rob. This phrase has nothing to do with money so I'll put my credit cards away – I'm not going to give you financial credit
     <em>
      or
     </em>
     credit in terms of praise.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No praise? Why's that?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     你 别骗人了，我才不会表扬你呢 - you didn't really walk the dog because you haven't got one - the car is still dirty - and I did all the shopping, not you。所以没出力气就别抢功!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     What?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Don't take the credit for something you haven't done.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK. Well - here's another phrase for you - give credit where it's due...
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Meaning?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You should at least acknowledge the things I
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     done - like turning up at the studio today to record this programme!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Rob - you are a credit to the BBC!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Ahh, thanks Li. Err... any chance I could borrow your credit card now?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Both
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Bye!
