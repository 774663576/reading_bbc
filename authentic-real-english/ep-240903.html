     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的表达。I'm Feifei, and I'm joined by Georgie.

     Hi everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     在这期节目中，我们要来学习一个成语 “clutch at straws”。我和 Georgie 将先用英语为大家讲解 “clutch at straws” 的用法，最后再由我用汉语进行归纳总结。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, Feifei, how are you doing?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm very well, thank you. What about you?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, I'm good, thank you. Now, in this programme we're looking at the idiom 'clutch at straws'. Ever heard of this one, Feifei?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, I have, it's actually quite common. So, the verb 'clutch' means to hold something tightly with your hands. And 'straws' – Georgie, are we talking about the long, hollow tubes we use to drink things?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No, this idiom comes from an old proverb where 'straws' is actually a thin plant that grows near a river. If you're clutching at straws, you're trying to save yourself from drowning in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I didn't know that! But that helps us to understand its metaphorical meaning. We use 'clutch at straws' when someone is trying to improve a difficult situation, using methods that are a bit desperate and don't seem likely to work. Let's hear some examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I was doing a marathon, and I needed some people to sponsor me, but no one was giving me money, so, I was really clutching at straws, and I had to go to my neighbour instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, in my French class, we had to give a presentation on something interesting, and everyone had really good ideas, and I couldn't think of anything. So, I was really clutching at straws.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was one day before Christmas Eve, and I had nothing in my fridge! In the end I had to serve everyone with beans on toast… I was really clutching at straws there.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, we've heard examples of people trying to fix a situation by doing something desperate or extreme, but we also often use it when people say things that are a bit desperate, usually during an argument. If their reasons for something are weak and a bit desperate, we can say they are clutching at straws.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, and Feifei… I know I've only been at work for an hour, and I haven't done much, but I already need a break. Do you think I deserve one?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I think you're clutching at straws a bit there, Georgie. Here is another example. My son ate all his vegetables at dinner last night, and afterwards, he asked me whether he could delay his bedtime till midnight!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgie
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, sounds like he was clutching at straws, but it was worth a try!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     It was. OK, let's recap.
    </p>
    <p>
     成语 “clutch at straws” 的意思是 “抓救命稻草”。这个成语用来比喻在非常困难的情况下其实已经走投无路，但为了摆脱困境开始选择看似有效却并不靠谱的做法和解决方案，就像不小心掉进河里的时候想靠岸边纤细的稻草 “straws” 来把自己拉上岸。比如，你的电脑打不开了，写好的论文没法提交，于是你打算自己拆开电脑来修理，你的朋友就可能劝你 “Hey, stop clutching at straws, you are going to break it!” 意思就是 “别病急乱投医，你可能会彻底弄坏电脑的！” 除此之外，“clutch at straws” 还可以用来形容某人抛出的论点经不起推敲，显得只是急于找到借口。

     OK, remember to come back next time for another useful English phrase.
