     大家好欢迎收听《地道英语》我是杨莉…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     And hello, I'm Rob
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry, I didn't hear that.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     If I just take this head off… you can hear me. Hello!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's better but why are you wearing a life-size monkey costume Rob?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well my friend said I should wear it to his son's birthday party this morning – his son loves monkeys and it would make his birthday really special if he saw one!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     原来 Rob 的一个朋友为儿子举办聚会，他让 Rob 装扮成一只猴子去凑热闹。
     <br/>
     Well, that's very kind of you Rob – and how did the party go?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well that's the problem. As you can see, I dressed up like a monkey, travelled across London on the bus and there was no party!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ha ha – no party! 听上去你好像是被朋友当猴子一样给耍啦！ 这叫'making a monkey out of you'!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Making a monkey out of me? Yes, it's a good phrase. You mean he's trying to make me look foolish or to humiliate me.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He's certainly done that! 短语 'to make a monkey out of someone' 意思就是愚弄某人，让某人出洋相，也就是我们常说的被人耍（猴）啦！下面我们听几个例句：
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Mary made a monkey out me by telling to me to ask her best friend out on a date – she said no!
    </p>
    <p>
     My boyfriend's always making a monkey out of himself by getting drunk at parties.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sid made a monkey out of Paul by telling him to wear a suit to the party – everyone else was wearing jeans!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     这个词的意思很清楚了。不过，愚弄别人或被别愚弄都不是好事儿。我记得，好像还有一个类似的表达， 'making a fool out of someone'. So Rob, you're angry because he's made a fool out of you?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes! This phrase doesn't just apply to people who dress up like monkeys. It can apply to any situation where somewhere has been made to look foolish or ridiculous – like me!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     是的，这个表达的使用面儿更宽一些，而不仅仅限于装扮猴子式的捉弄或取笑。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     But Li, this phrase compares someone to a monkey because monkeys look like they are fooling around. And that makes me look really stupid!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Rob 越说越觉得自己像个傻猴子，可猴子一点儿都不傻呀! Ah but Rob, in Chinese culture, a monkey is seen as a clever animal and is often compared with a clever person.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh really? Well, in that case I might wear this monkey costume for a little bit longer. How does it make me look? Clever, smart?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Quite smart and quite handsome too.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh thanks very much!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
