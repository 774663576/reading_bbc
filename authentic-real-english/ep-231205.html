     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Beth. We have an expression which is used to say you have nothing left of something specific, particularly something that other people want – the phrase is 'I'm out'. Other pronouns can be used so we can say 'we're out' or 'you're out' as well.
    </p>
    <p>

     我们用 “I'm out” 来表示 “我这里没有之前谈话里提到的一样东西了”，特别是当我们需要用到这样东西的时候。这个表达里的代词可以替换，所以我们还可以说 “we're out” 或者 “she's out”、“he's out”、“they are out”。咱们来讲讲这个表达的具体用法。

     Do you remember that amazing new coffee I've been drinking? I know you like it, and I was going to get some for your birthday, but when I went to buy it, they were completely out.
    </p>
    <p>

     <br/>
     Oh no! Beth 本来想给我买我特别喜欢的咖啡作生日礼物，可是她发现 “they were completely out（店家那完全没货了）”。Thanks for trying anyway. Maybe there is another variety we could try?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I thought that, but it turned out there was a complete shortage of coffee – they were out of everything! They only had tea.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     <br/>
     It doesn't sound like a great shop if they don't have enough stock. So, did you buy me some tea?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I wanted to, but then I realised I didn't have any money. I was out. Let's hear some more examples.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A: I'm doing a sponsored run. Can you give me some change?
     <br/>
     B: Sorry, erm, I'm all out.
    </p>
    <p>
     A: Are you still giving away free chocolate?
     <br/>
     B: Sorry, we're out!
    </p>
    <p>
     I can't believe how popular that new book was. We're out already. Let's order more.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们学习了如何用 “I'm out” 来表达 “我这里没有你提到的那样东西了，一点也不剩”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Now we've been using 'out', but it's also really common to say 'I'm all out' or 'I'm completely out'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     我们也可以用 “I'm all out” 或者 “I'm completely out” 来表达同样的意思，强调 “真的一点也没有了”，尤其是用在表示没有钱的上下文中：“我真的没钱了”。That reminds me, Beth, you still need to buy me something for my birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, start thinking about what you'd like. I'm all out of ideas! Bye for now!
    </p>

     Bye-bye!
