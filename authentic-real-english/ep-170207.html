     大家好，欢迎收听BBC英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>

     </strong>
     …and hello, I'm Neil. So Feifei, did you enjoy Jane's leaving party last night?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh yeah, it was great. 我们的同事 Jane 离职了，昨晚我们给她办了一个告别会。还有好多吃的，喝的……
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     But that was the only reason, was it? Weren't you sad to see her leave? You've worked with her for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh… right… yes. Very sad. Jane 找到了一份新工作所以要离开我们，我当然很伤心了。Such a shame to see her go: we were such good friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Friends! Really? Didn't she tell the boss when you took that extra-long lunch break?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     那倒是，不过我们平时的关系还是很好的。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm, and didn't you once punch her when she tried to chat up your boyfriend at the Christmas party?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     OK, OK, I didn't like her that much.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, it sounds like you really were her 'frenemy' – someone who pretends to be her friend but is really her enemy. It's a combination of two words – friend and enemy. Get it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, a fren-emy! 在英语里，一个笑脸相迎、伪装成朋友的敌人或者和我们互相竞争的同伴就叫“frenemy友敌”。Hmm, I've never had one of those before.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Really? Well, let's hear this word in action.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     She seems so false. I wouldn't trust her – she's just a frenemy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tania's been my frenemy for years – I'd go for a quick drink with her but that's it!
    </p>
    <p>
     Tom's just my frenemy – I pretend to like him but really I can't stand him!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     合成词 frenemy 的意思就是“一个表面上假装和我们做朋友但实际背后不认可、不喜欢我们的人”。 I wonder if I was
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     frenemy?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm afraid you were. She told me she was only friends with you so she could share your biscuits – but she really didn't like you. She told me at the party last night.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Thank goodness we are real friends, Neil – at least we can be honest with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, actually, I don't like you much either. I only pretend to be your friend when I'm presenting this programme!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     你也是我的“友敌”？
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, don't cry, Feifei. I'm only joking.
