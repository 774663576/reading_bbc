     Hi everyone. 大家好我是杨莉，欢迎收听《地道英语》。趁着 Rob还没到我要赶紧找找我的交通卡。I couldn't find my Travelcard this morning. I hope I haven't lost it.
    </p>

      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hi Li, sorry I'm late.
     <em>
      (Rob looks at Li)
     </em>
     Li, what are you doing? You've emptied your handbag all over the floor!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, hi Rob, I wasn't expecting you to be here so soon. 不好意思啊，我的东西摊了满地。Oh dear, this must look terrible, but believe me, there's method to my madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You've made a mess all over the floor and you're telling me you've gone mad!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     没有没有，我可没有疯。No, I haven't gone mad, well, I hope not! 我刚才使用了一个地道的英语表达。The phrase 'there's method to my madness' 意思是，虽然我的行为看上去难以理喻，但我这样做是有原因的。I'm surprised that you didn't know this phrase!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm only joking. Of course I know this phrase. 'There's method to my madness' or you could say 'there's method in my madness', means you are doing something that looks strange but you have a plan and really, you are doing something very sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, that's exactly right. 你解释得很好。讲话者的意思是，“我有一个不合乎常理，但实际上很聪明的办法”。As you can see, I've emptied my handbag over the floor because it'll be easier and quicker to find my Travelcard. Then I'll re-pack my handbag.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's good to hear. Well, this is the phrase for Authentic Real English today. Let's hear some examples of how it is used.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm driving to my friend's house today but I'm going to take the long route, avoiding the motorway. There's method to my madness, I think the motorway will be very busy and the longer route will be quicker.
    </p>
    <p>
     A: What are you doing putting all the books on the floor?
     <br/>
     B: There's method to my madness, I'm taking a photo of the books I'm putting away. The photos will help me locate the books more easily.
     <br/>
     A: Oh, that's clever.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So Li, have you found your Travelcard?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes! 找到啦！一定是被压在了包的最底下了。You see, there was method to my madness.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well done Li. Well, I'm going now. I'll leave you to tidy up your mess!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Li
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Thanks Rob.
    </p>

     Bye everyone!
