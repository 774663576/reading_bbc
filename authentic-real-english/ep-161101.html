     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的《地道英语》节目。我是冯菲菲。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     …and me, Rob. Hello! Hey Feifei, you know that expression 'to wash your dirty linen in public'?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. 表达 wash your dirty linen in public 的字面意思是“在公开场合洗脏的针织品”实际要表达的意思是在公开场合毫无忌讳地谈论私密的事情，好比俗话说的“家丑外扬”。You wouldn't catch me doing that!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Nor me – I always keep private matters private - but anyway it's exactly what Daisy and Tom have been doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What? They've been washing their dirty linen in public – you mean they've been arguing?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Not exactly – but yesterday, they were out in the garden making lots of noise.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh I see. Actually Rob I think…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
     </strong>
     <br/>
     …and I'm sure Daisy said something about hanging Tom out to dry.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     行了、行了 Rob，你就别再猜下去了，我知道是怎么回事儿，不过咱们还是先来听几个使用这个表达的例句吧。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Tim kept discussing his brother's drinking problem at the pub but I told him not to wash his dirty linen in public.
    </p>
    <p>
     I know he's having an affair but do they have to wash their dirty linen in public?
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't wash your dirty linen in public, save your argument for when you get home!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Wash your dirty linen in public 的意思就是在公开场合谈论私人的秘密。不过话说，我觉得 Daisy 和 Tom 可不会在院子里谈论自己家里的事儿。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     But I could hear what was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Are you sure? Because I spoke to Daisy and she said their washing machine had broken down and they were actually washing their clothes outdoors, in the garden. I think the noise was just them having a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     But what about Daisy saying she was going to hang Tom out to dry?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I think she meant she was going to hang Tom's
     <em>
      clothes
     </em>
     out to dry. 你就别再瞎操心了，and then you won't hear people washing their dirty linen in public – either literally or metaphorically!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Rob
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Thanks for the advice Feifei. Bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Bye.
