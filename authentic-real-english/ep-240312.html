     We have an expression which means to carefully plan an idea – it's 'cook up an idea'.
    </p>

     'Cook up an idea'.  So, are there any ideas that you've been cooking up, Phil?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     Yes, it's my son's birthday soon – and I'm trying to cook up a party idea that he'll really like.
    </p>

     Children can be hard to please, so I hope you can cook up a good idea.

     Don't worry, I've been thinking about this for months – it takes time to cook up an idea this well. It's going to be a surprise party.
    </p>

     I love surprise parties! I threw a surprise party for my parents last year. It was amazing, but I spent a long time cooking up the idea. “Cook up an idea” 这个表达很形象，它听起来像是你把很多食材放在一起，然后做成一个特别的东西。
    </p>

     Yes, sometimes you need a lot of things to cook up an idea. It can be hard work! Let's hear some more examples.

     Don't disturb her! She's working on her own to cook up an idea for our project.
    </p>
    <p>
     You've always wanted to start up a company. I'm glad you've managed to cook up this idea!
    </p>
    <p>
     I didn't know how we were going to see all those places in one day, but I hadn't realised Paulo had been cooking up a plan. It was amazing!

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们正在学习 “cook up an idea” 这个表达。它的意思就是 “to carefully plan something（精心策划某事）”。我们还可以说 “cook up a plan”，意思就是 “精心制定一个计划”。不论是 “cook up an idea” 还是 “cook up a plan”，重点都是单词 “cook”，它暗示了这个计划是人们精心炮制出的结果。

     You could say that the best plans have many ingredients, and that you have to combine them in the right way. That's why the best ideas can take some time to cook up.
    </p>

     That reminds me, I've got a couple of friends visiting, and they don't really like each other, but I've cooked up a plan to get them to speak to each other.
    </p>

     Well, I hope it works, and we'll see you next time! Bye.
