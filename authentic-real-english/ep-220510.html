     内容简介
    </h3>
    <p>
     主持人 Roy 想向上级提出一些想法，来帮助大家提高工作效率。同事佳莹却觉得这些想法异想天开，不可能被批准，她用到了口语搭配 “as if” —— 这是什么意思？听对话，学习用英语表达你不相信某人说的话或不认为某件事情会发生。

     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目，我是佳莹。

     And hello, I’m Roy. I’ve just applied to be the new head of department. My main policy will be that everybody will be able to sing karaoke in the office, and there will be donkeys that deliver drinks to people! I think the senior management will think that’s a great idea and agree to all of my changes.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You think management would accept that much chaos which would damage productivity? As if!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     <br/>
     As if what? You want an example? I don’t understand!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     不是的。单独使用搭配 “as if”，可以表示 “才怪，不是这样” 或者 “没影的事儿”。这是一个非正式的表达。
    </p>
    <p>

     <br/>
     So you think they won’t accept my idea? That’s ridiculous. In fact, the senior management has agreed to hold a meeting in ten minutes. I think I’ll be head of department by the end of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     As if! No one will agree to that idea! We can talk about your meeting after these examples.
    </p>

      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You think her second novel was better than her first? As if!
    </p>
    <p>
     She thinks she could win the award for best short film. As if! It’s rubbish!
    </p>
    <p>
     As if! I will never become president of the company!
    </p>

     这里是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。我们正在介绍搭配 “as if” 在口语中的含义和用法。我们可以用 “as if” 来表达不相信某件事情是真的，或觉得这件事情不可能发生，就像我们汉语里说的 “才怪，没影的事儿”。So, how did your meeting go?
    </p>

     Well, I arrived on the floor, but I think they’d given me the wrong floor number. Instead, the eighth floor is where all the rubbish in the building goes to get sorted. It’s strange because that’s also the place I’ve been told to send some of my other best ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Maybe they were trying to tell you something by sending your work to the eighth floor where the rubbish goes!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     As if! My ideas are great, and I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before I get promoted.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, actually, they’ve offered me the position. They liked the idea that by making people work four-day weeks, productivity would go up!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     As if!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry, Roy, but it’s true! Look!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I can’t believe it! So that means you’re my boss now? Now I can send all my great ideas to you!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Jiaying
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I think you should just send them straight to the eighth floor. Bye!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Roy

     <br/>
     Bye…
