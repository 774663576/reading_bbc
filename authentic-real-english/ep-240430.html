     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。I'm Feifei.

     And I'm Neil. In this episode, we're going to look at an expression which is all about finding something that solves a problem – 'do the trick'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Do the trick. 这个表达的意思是 “奏效，起作用，给你想要的结果”。Neil, can you give us an example to show how we use this?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     OK, I was looking for something to make my front room look nicer. It's a bit boring at the moment. But look at this, I've found a really nice picture to put on the wall. I wanted to brighten things up and I think this really does the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Let me see the picture! Oh, yes, that looks amazing. That'll certainly do the trick! 大家要特别注意，不要把表达 “do the trick” 和 “do tricks（变戏法）” 混淆。We might talk about a magician, or a skateboarder doing tricks, but this is nothing like that, is it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     No, not at all. When we say something 'does the trick', it doesn't literally do a trick – it just solves a problem. Like my boring-looking front room.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     You know what, you should get a nice bright rug. I wanted to make my room look more interesting, I bought one and it really did the trick!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'll remember that. Now, if you want a better idea of how to use this expression, these examples should do the trick quite nicely.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Vinegar works well here, but if you don't have any, some lemon juice should do the trick.
    </p>
    <p>
     When people are angry with you, sometimes just a few kind words can do the trick and calm them down.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you need the motor to work better, a squirt of oil will usually do the trick.
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。上面我们听了三个使用了表达 “do the trick” 的例句。在日常交流中，我们用表达 “do the trick” 来表示 “一件事情或行动可以解决一个问题或给你想要的结果”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
     </strong>
     <br/>
     We often use it when we're explaining how to do something, and we want to suggest the best way to achieve it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     和表达 “do the trick” 意思相同的另一个说法是 “do the job”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Neil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes, if you're struggling to learn new words, then a bit of focussed practice really does the job.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hopefully our explanation has done the trick, and we'll see you in the next episode. Bye!
    </p>

     Goodbye.
