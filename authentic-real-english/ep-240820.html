     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的表达。Welcome! This is Feifei, and I'm here with Phil.

     Hello, everyone!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">

     </strong>
     在这期节目中，我们要介绍的表达是 “find your groove”。我和 Phil 将先用英语为大家讲解这个表达的用法，最后再由我用汉语进行归纳总结。
    </p>

     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, how are you, Feifei? I keep hearing you humming tunes around the office – are you happy about something?
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>

     </strong>
     I am! I'm really getting into music. I've started playing the piano – it was difficult at first, but now I'm really finding my groove.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     That's good to hear, and 'find your groove' is the expression that we're learning in this programme. What does it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Let's start with 'groove'. We can use it to talk about a rhythm or a piece of music that's easy to dance to. When you find your groove, it means you find you can do something easily, and that you really start to enjoy it. Whether that's playing music or something else.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm glad you've found your groove with the piano, but as you said, it's not just music. So, at work recently, I've started editing a lot of videos. It was difficult at first, but I've really found my groove with it. It's becoming a lot easier.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh that's good! Now let's listen to some people using the expression 'find your groove'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, I moved house a few weeks ago, and my commute to work changed. I now have to get two trains to work, and I kept getting lost. But recently, I found my groove. It's much easier now.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've got a new job. I have to present to clients on a daily basis. I found it difficult at first, but I'm finally starting to find my groove.
    </p>
    <p>
     I've joined a new football team. We didn't really know each other well, but now we do, and we play really well. We finally found our groove and won some games.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, we've said finding your groove is about getting good at something and starting to really enjoy it. Are there any other ways to use it?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Well, a similar way that we use it is to talk about finding an activity that you enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     So, you could say: 'You should try something creative, music, painting, dancing – you've just got to find your groove'.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Phil
      <br/>
     </strong>
     I'm glad you found your groove with the piano. Now I think I need to find my groove. Maybe I should try dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Hmm, I'm not sure you're ready for that – but give it a try, maybe you'll find your groove!
    </p>
    <p>
     英语表达 “find your groove” 的字面意思是 “找到你的节奏”。比如，当我们听到一段喜欢的音乐时，可能会随着节奏哼唱起来。而这个短语的引申义就是 “找到一件对自己来说擅长且热爱的事情”。特别是我们可以用 “find your groove” 来鼓励身边的人多多尝试担心对自己有些难度的爱好，从而找到既喜欢又擅长的事。比如，你的朋友对蛋糕制作很感兴趣，但十分担心自己做的蛋糕不好吃，你就可以鼓励他说 “Give it a try, maybe you will find your groove baking delicious cakes!（尝试一下，也许你就会发现你能自然而然地照自己的节奏烤出美味的蛋糕！）” Well, I hope you can all find your groove.
    </p>

     </strong>
     OK, that's all from us. We'll be back next time with another useful English phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     See you then.
    </p>
    <p>

     Bye!
