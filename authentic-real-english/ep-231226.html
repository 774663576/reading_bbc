     And I'm Beth. We have an expression all about being very happy, particularly when your face suddenly reflects how happy or excited you are. It's a nice phrase for Christmas, and it has a Christmas word in it – it's 'light up like a Christmas tree'.

     Light up like a Christmas tree. 这个表达可以被用来形容人喜上眉梢，顿时满面笑容的神情，正如它的字面意思 “像圣诞树一样被点亮（light up a Christmas tree）”。

     When you turn on the lights, it's suddenly much brighter – it's full of life and energy. Now, imagine this being your face. Last year, I got a puppy for Christmas. It was such a shock. When I saw him, I lit up like a Christmas tree. I was so happy!
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     Wow. I can imagine your face – so excited! When I was a child, I really wanted a doll's house. I didn't expect to get one, but I did! I lit up like a Christmas tree.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     So, in both these situations, we were surprised – a happy surprise, and our faces reflected that. But this expression doesn't always have to be used with a surprise or Christmas.

     是的，“light up like a Christmas tree” 除了可以用来描述惊喜，也可以用来表达简单的喜悦之情。比如：Whenever I see my family after a while, I light up like a Christmas tree. 每当我和久别的家人相聚时，就无比高兴。

     Yesterday, my nephew lit up like a Christmas tree when I told him we could make a snowman! He was very excited. Let's hear some more examples.

     你正在收听的是 BBC英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们介绍了如何用表达 “light up like a Christmas tree” 来形容人因惊喜或开心而喜笑颜开、喜上眉梢的神情。

     Now, we've been using it so far metaphorically to mean you look excited about something, but we can also use it more literally, especially when a place is particularly bright, with a lot of lights.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     除了用来形容人突然喜笑颜开的神情，这个表达还能描述某个地方的照明或灯光炫彩夺目。比如：I went to Paris last weekend, and at night, the Eiffel Tower was lit up like a Christmas tree! 我上周末去了巴黎，夜晚的埃菲尔铁塔灯光绚丽、光彩夺目！
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Ah, yes. It's covered in lights. It's always lit up like a Christmas tree at night. I better go, it's time for our Christmas party! See you next time.
    </p>
