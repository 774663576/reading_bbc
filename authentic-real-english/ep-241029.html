     大家好，欢迎收听 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。在每期节目中，我们都会介绍一个英语母语人士或讲英语流利的人会用到的习惯用语或者短语。I'm Feifei, and I'm with Beth.

     Hi everyone.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">

     本期节目中我们要学习一个习语——“off the scale”。
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>

     Now, I heard this when I was chatting to a friend about her holiday. She said that she went to an amazing restaurant, and the food was 'off the scale'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ah yes. 'Off the scale'. It's a funny expression because 'scale' makes it sound like the food is being measured, but that's not what she meant, I guess.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yeah, exactly. She meant that the food was so good that it can't be rated on a normal scale. So, we use 'off the scale' to say that something goes beyond what is expected, and it's usually used in a positive way.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Yes. For example, an influencer said the restaurant around the corner serves the most authentic Chinese food, and since then, bookings have been off the scale.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Oh, maybe I should try and get in there then!
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     Here are some more examples of 'off the scale'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Examples
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Last week I went to see my local football team beating their closest rivals, and the celebrations were off the scale.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     My boyfriend cooked me dinner yesterday, and he made this amazing roast chicken. It was delicious, it was just off the scale.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     I remember passing my driving test. The sense of achievement afterwards was just off the scale, it was so exciting!
    </p>

     你正在收听的是 BBC 英语教学的 “地道英语” 节目。以上我们一起学习了 “off the scale” 的用法。“Off the scale” 的意思是 “超出常规”。“Scale” 作名词的时候有 “规模，范围” 的意思。如果 “某个事物超出了常规，无法用通常的方式测量或者是估计”，那么这个时候我们就用 “off the scale” 来形容它。比如，当我们想要形容一位演员表演精彩得出奇，就可以说：“The actress gave an off-the-scale performance.”
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     So, 'off the scale' is used when something is beyond the usual limits, and though it's normally used positively, it can be negative too. And we can also use it to describe an adjective.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes. For example, if someone is really annoying you, you might say they are annoying, or even 'off the scale annoying'.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Beth
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Or maybe you're so hungry that you could say you are 'off the scale hungry', which means exceptionally hungry.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
     <strong>
      Feifei
      <br/>
     </strong>
     “Off the scale hungry” 的意思就是 “超级饿，饿得不行了”，这里，“off the scale” 是副词。好了，希望你在听了这期节目后学会了 “off the scale” 的用法。
    </p>

     <br/>
     And that's all from us. We'll be back next time with another useful English phrase. See you then!
    </p>
