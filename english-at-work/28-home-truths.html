     Hello again. Tip Top 贸易公司的顶级上司 Mr Socrates 刚刚宣布了公司的新策略，希望能够提高欧洲市场的销售额，保住公司。不过在工作正式开始前， 伦敦公司的团队请他到酒吧做客，感受一下英国风情。 Let’s join them now…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, welcome to the Rose and Crown. It is small – not like one of those bars you get in… in your country. Can I get you a pint, Mr Socrates?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A what?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A pint. A pint of beer. It’s really nice here if you like it…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I don’t drink. Just an orange juice, freshly squeezed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Paul
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, go on, Mr Socrates. One pint won’t hurt. You’ve got to have a pint of beer when you come to a pub.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, very well. I’ll try one. It’d better be good.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     You’ll love it. Right, I’ll get it. Three pints of your best beer, please, Mr Landlord. Denise, are you OK getting your own? I’m a bit short of cash.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh… right. Mr Socrates, Anna said she would be along soon. She had some work to finish. She’s such a hard worker.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good to hear. She seems like a smart cookie. Now let’s try this beer. Mmm, not bad. A little warm, but… tasty.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Paul
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, you drank that quickly. Would you like another one?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hi, everyone. Sorry I’m late.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hi, Anna. Look, Mr Socrates is enjoying our English beer. I think it’s going to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Anna! Our best worker. Get Anna a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, Mr Socrates. Of course, Mr Socrates.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Anna, come over here. Let’s talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, right. What about…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There you go, Anna. I got you some crisps too. So what are we talking about?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Nothing. Thank you… Bye-bye.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, right. Yeah, bye-bye. I’ll go and talk to Paul and Denise. I’ll just be over here.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What a loser. I can tell he’s all talk and no action.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, Tom’s a good worker really and…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     …and as for Paul. God, what a manager. Always eating cookies. You know, he was fired from his last job because…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Narrator
     </strong>
     <br/>
     安娜，我看他是有点喝醉了，说了不应该说的话。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I know. What should I say?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Narrator
     </strong>
     <br/>
     你得告诉他不能这么说：It’s not appropriate to talk like that. 或者他得改变话题：Could we change the subject, please.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     OK, thanks. Erm, Mr Socrates, I don’t think it’s appropriate to talk like that. Could we change the subject, please?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, sorry. Have I said too much? Maybe we could talk about you. I like you, Anna. You’re keen but you’ve got a lot to learn, and I think you should wear more black – it makes you look… thinner…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Narrator
     </strong>
     <br/>
     这可不像话。他说得太多了。你得让他保持职业道德，就谈公司的事儿。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Right, good idea. Erm, Mr Socrates, thank you. But can we keep our conversation professional? There’s a lot to discuss about our European market strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yeah, right, absolutely right. Anyway, you’re gonna have to lead this one not that Tom guy. I’m thinking of firing him. His results ain't that great and…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sorry to interrupt. Just wondered if you’d like some nuts?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hey, Tom, I was just saying to Anna your results haven’t been that good and I’m thinking of…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     … of having another drink… thinking of having another drink. Mr Socrates, did you know Tom actually has a great idea for selling laser-curved oranges to Spain?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Do I?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That’s good to hear, Tom. Email them to me and I’ll check them over tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Of course he will, Mr Socrates. Now, how would you like to drink something, err, less strong? Orange juice perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Mr Socrates
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Nah, nah, I think I’ll try some more of the English beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Narrator
     </strong>
     <br/>
     安娜这次帮了 Tom 大忙了，要不他马上就要被炒鱿鱼了。有时候和上司会谈时会突然说到私人话题，所以需要恰当地把话题再转回到工作上。我看安娜已经学会怎样保持话题的职业性。以下是她用到的一些句子：
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s not appropriate to talk like that.
     <br/>
     Could we change the subject, please?
     <br/>
     Can we keep our conversation professional, please?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Narrator
     </strong>
     <br/>
     看来安娜是 Mr Socrates 眼里的红人，不过她得向 Tom 做些解释呢。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Anna, what were you talking about to Mr Socrates? “Ideas for selling laser-curved oranges to Spain.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     He was going to fire you – so I was trying to tell him you had great ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What?! You helped me? Anna, I don’t know what to say. I… I…
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I need to go back to the office to work on some ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Narrator
     </strong>
     <br/>
     好主意！我们下次节目再会。Bye!
