     Hello again. 这可真令人兴奋！经理 Paul 派安娜和 Tom 去法国，希望能拿到一家大客户的塑料水果订单。不过 Tom 想的仅仅是工作吗？
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Really? What… me and Anna… to France?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Paul
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, but make sure you get that contract signed. We need the business.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yeah, yeah, of course. Are we staying overnight?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Paul
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There's no money for that – just get there and come straight back. Oh and could you bring back those nice French biscuits they have in the duty-free shop?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sure. So, Anna, we're off on holiday together, are we?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No! But I've got to book the flights online, can you help me, please?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ow, it’s not my thing. I'm sure Denise will help. I need to go and pack for this trip.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, Marge… in the cupboard… envelopes, apparently… Tom and Anna… oh, here she is… got to go, Marge… bye. Hello, Anna, everything OK?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Sort of. I've got to go to France with Tom.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, I know. I thought you'd be pleased to go with Tom, after your time in the stationery cupboard with him!
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I was just finding an envelope, Denise. Anyway, I'm worried about booking the flights online. I usually book flights at a travel agent's.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     It's company policy now, we have to do everything online – even my food shopping – but don’t tell Paul.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, right. So, where shall I begin?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Pull up a chair, Anna, and we'll log on. Right, let's start with the British Airlines' website. There. London to Marseille. What is the outbound date?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Going out tomorrow, back tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Business class or economy class? I think we'll say economy.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     That's cheaper, I guess. What's this mean? Flexible or fixed?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     A flexible ticket means you can change your flight but a fixed one means you can't – and that's cheaper, so we'll choose that one. I'll book you on the 8am flight from Heathrow and flying home at 6pm. I just need to type in your full names now and select your seats. Window or aisle?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     I'll what?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     No, Anna. A seat by the aisle or by the window?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, an aisle seat please, Denise.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Good. What's your frequent flyer number?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, I don't have one of those.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     What's that? Frequent flyer number? Here, I've got a gold status card. Can you stick my number in?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Gold status! Where did you get that?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Oh, I've flown loads of times for business. I've done deals all around the world.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">

     他才不是呢！花公司的钱到处旅游、晒太阳，可是正事儿没办多少！
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Hmm, really? Right, I just need to pay now… using the company account, of course.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Cool. Now, what do you think of my sunglasses?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Lovely, Tom. Denise has booked you a window seat, OK?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Ahh, no! Sorry, I can't sit by the window… I’m… errr…
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, Tom?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Well, I mean, it's only polite that the lady sits by the window.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Really?!
    </p>

     这像什么话？但愿他能帮到安娜的忙，可别是倒忙！好吧，让我们再复习一下订机票时会用到的语言。

     往返日程是什么？
     <br/>
     What's the outbound and return date?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     你想要商务舱还是经济舱？
     <br/>
     Do you want to fly business or economy?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     你想要日期固定的机票还是允许更改日期的机票？
     <br/>
     Do you want a fixed or flexible ticket?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     你想坐靠窗的位子还是靠走廊的位子？
     <br/>
     Would you like a window or aisle seat?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     你有飞行常客积分卡吗？
     <br/>
     Have you got a frequent flyer number?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Denise
     </strong>
     <br/>
     There you go, you two – your e-ticket. Now don't forget your passports.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Thanks, Denise. Hey, Anna, I'm so pleased that we're on this trip together. It'll be nice to spend some time with you.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes, and to do some business, and really show Paul we are his best employees.
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yeah, of course… I just wondered…
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Anna
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Yes?
    </p>
    <p class="BodyA">
     <strong>
      Tom
     </strong>
     <br/>
     Is there any chance I could sit in the aisle seat?
    </p>

     我觉得安娜这次行程可能会碰到不少麻烦。不知道旅行到底会怎样？我们下次节目再看看吧！
