     分手后还可不可以和前任继续做朋友？有些人认为一段感情结束后，最好和前任一刀两断；而另一些人则认为这样做未免过于极端。本期 “随身英语” 围绕能否与前任维持友谊这个话题展开讨论。

     <strong>
      Breaking up
     </strong>
     is hard to do – or so some people say. If you’re in a
     <strong>
      relationship
     </strong>
     but not as
     <strong>
      loved-up
     </strong>
     as you once were, when is the right time to
     <strong>
      call it a day
     </strong>
     ? The longer the relationship, the harder it can be. But once you do make the break, is it still possible to maintain a
     <strong>
      friendship
     </strong>
     with your ex-partner?
    </p>
    <p>
     When you’ve been
     <strong>
      dumped
     </strong>
     , the classic line that’s often used is ‘let’s just be friends’. That can be either
     <strong>
      wishful thinking
     </strong>
     or something to soften the blow of bad news. However, when you
     <strong>
      fell
     </strong>
     madly
     <strong>
      in love
     </strong>
     with your partner all those weeks, months or years ago, it would have been hard to imagine you’d fall out of love. And so salvaging something from that time, and remaining friends, could be a good thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s good if a break-up is
     <strong>
      amicable
     </strong>
     – it avoids the hate, pain and anger that can eat away at us and affect our mental health. If you can accept you’ve had some good times but it’s time to
     <strong>
      move on
     </strong>
     , then all the better – besides, you won’t have to cancel your ex-partner from social media or delete their name from your contacts! If you can appreciate the
     <strong>
      mutual
     </strong>
     interests you had then there’s no reason why you can’t continue a
     <strong>
      platonic
     </strong>
     relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
     But holding onto the past and staying friends doesn’t always work – you just have to accept you and your partner just weren’t
     <strong>
      compatible
     </strong>
     , therefore it’s best to give each other space, to look forward, and try to get any
     <strong>
      romantic
     </strong>
     feelings you once had
     <strong>
      out of your system
     </strong>
     . And according to some, staying friends with your ex isn’t a good option. Marie-Claire Chappet told the BBC, “It does nothing but prolong the pain of the break-up”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Helen Fisher, a neurologist at the Kinsey Institute who’s been studying the psychology in relationships, also told the BBC: “The way to accelerate mending a
     <strong>
      broken heart
     </strong>
     is similar to treating addiction – you put away their things, stop looking at their social media and have no contact with them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     So, maybe it’s time to get in touch with your real friends, instead of seeking friendship with ‘a ghost from the past’.
