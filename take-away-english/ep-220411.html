     Many of us love live music –
     <strong>
      listening
     </strong>
     to the singer
     <strong>
      belting out
     </strong>
     classics we love to sing along to. But while it can be lots of fun
     <strong>
      nodding our heads
     </strong>
     to the
     <strong>
      tunes
     </strong>
     <strong>
      booming out
     </strong>
     , it can also harm our hearing. Studies suggest that one in ten adults have had their hearing damaged by loud
     <strong>
      noises
     </strong>
     or music. So why is loud music damaging, and what can we do to prevent it from harming our ears?
    </p>
    <p>
     Inside our ears, there are lots of tiny hair-like cells located in the cochlea. These cells are referred to as
     <strong>
      hair cells
     </strong>
     because very small bundles of stereocilia, which look like hairs under a microscope, sit on top of each cell. These groupings of stereocilia can be damaged when exposed to prolonged loud noises. Once damaged, these cells cannot respond to sound, and therefore we are left with
     <strong>
      noise-induced
     </strong>
     <strong>
      hearing loss
     </strong>
     – which can be permanent. It can also leave us with a constant
     <strong>
      ringing
     </strong>
     sound in our ears, which is known as
     <strong>
      tinnitus
     </strong>
     . So, what sounds are too loud?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sound is measured in
     <strong>
      decibels
     </strong>
     . The maximum safe level of sound humans are thought to be able to withstand without potential damage is 80db. The
     <strong>
      bangs
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      booms
     </strong>
     of a firework display can reach 120db, the
     <strong>
      whirring mechanical
     </strong>
     sound of a food processor can be around 85db, and live music can be around 110db. If these sounds continue for a long period of time, it puts our unprotected ears at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     So what can we do to protect our ears? Firstly, when listening to music, especially while using your
     <strong>
      headphones
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      earphones
     </strong>
     , make sure you keep it at a sensible
     <strong>
      volume
     </strong>
     . Also, don’t get too close to speakers that are
     <strong>
      blaring out
     </strong>
     music. And, if you go to live concerts, why not take some
     <strong>
      earbuds
     </strong>
     with you? Finally, if you get a ringing sensation in your ears, it might be wise to speak to your doctor as soon as possible. Your hearing is important, but there are some steps you can take to be as safe as possible.
