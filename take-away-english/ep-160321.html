     Have you ever fancied sailing around the world in your own yacht or buying a holiday home in the Caribbean? Well, before you get too excited, it may help to find out if you have what it takes to become a
     <strong>
      billionaire
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     We've all heard stories of
     <strong>
      school drop-outs
     </strong>
     who have
     <strong>
      made their fortune
     </strong>
     , but are they the norm or an exception to the rule? Do they tend to be
     <strong>
      university graduates
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      self-made
     </strong>
     <strong>
      entrepreneurs
     </strong>
     ? Are they married or single?
    </p>
    <p>
     Thanks to a recent analysis of people in Forbes Top 100 Billionaires List, we can now find out what the world's
     <strong>
      mega rich
     </strong>
     have in common. We know which star sign is the most popular amongst multi-millionaires, what percentage wear glasses and even how many are bald!
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are deciding whether or not to go to university, it may help you to know that 76% of the richest people in the world have a degree. According to this study, of those 76%, 47% have a bachelor's degree, 23% have a master's and 6% have a doctorate.  Don't lose hope if you aren't very academic though. It's worth noting that many of those on the list did not
     <strong>
      pass all their exams with flying colours
     </strong>
     . Microsoft
     <strong>
      founder
     </strong>
     Bill Gates
     <strong>
      dropped out of
     </strong>
     Harvard University after two years of study. And Chinese business
     <strong>
      magnate
     </strong>
     Jack Ma, failed his university entrance exams three times before going on to complete his degree and make his millions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another interesting trend is that the world's
     <strong>
      high-fliers
     </strong>
     are much more likely to be married - only 12% of billionaires are unmarried. You are also more likely
     <strong>
      to make it
     </strong>
     if you were born under the most popular star sign, Aquarius, than if you are a Cancer - the least popular sign on the zodiac. Finally, the percentage of billionaires who are bald is quite high – so don't worry if you're losing your hair, you may get to sail that yacht around the Caribbean after all!
