      Vocabulary: crazes 词汇：风行一时的东西
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Have you got an
     <strong>
      addictive nature
     </strong>
     ? Are you unable to stop yourself joining in with the latest
     <strong>
      obsession
     </strong>
     for collecting or doing something? This probably describes most of us because it's only human nature to not want to miss out on something that everyone else is talking about.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most
     <strong>
      fads
     </strong>
     arrive suddenly and
     <strong>
      enthusiasm
     </strong>
     for them spreads quickly. They become a
     <strong>
      talking point
     </strong>
     on social media; we read about them, give them a try and, before we know it, we are
     <strong>
      hooked
     </strong>
     . In the past, these have been objects such as toys and games. Maybe you were the proud owner of a Rubik's cube, which became the
     <strong>
      best-selling
     </strong>
     toy of all time – around 350 million have been sold so far.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, technology is driving the latest crazes. In some parts of the world,
     <strong>
      flavour of the month
     </strong>
     is
     <em>
      Pokémon Go
     </em>
     – a game that uses
     <strong>
      augmented reality
     </strong>
     , where little
     <strong>
      virtual
     </strong>
     monsters pop up onto your phone and you have to catch them. And games such as Angry Birds and Minecraft are other crazes, available on smartphones and tablets, that have been hard
     <strong>
      to put down
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Our keeness to participate in crazes has been analysed by experts. One of them, Dr Ben Michaelis, a clinical psychologist, explains that we want to experience the benefit that another person, or group of people, have experienced from something and this "hooks into an ancient evolutionary fear of being left behind or abandoned by our tribes"; we have to join in or lose out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although becoming addicted to a computer game might not seem like a 'benefit', it can at least give you
     <strong>
      credibility
     </strong>
     or popularity among your friends. It allows you to learn new skills and gives you something to talk about at parties!
    </p>
    <p>
     But fashions
     <strong>
      come and go
     </strong>
     and most fads are just
     <strong>
      a flash in the pan
     </strong>
     so if one of them is
     <strong>
      not your cup of tea
     </strong>
     , don't worry: there'll be a new craze arriving very soon. Look at the addiction to the unsophisticated
     <strong>
      loom bands
     </strong>
     – those little rubber bands you could make jewellery and other things out of. For a brief period they were the
     <strong>
      must-have
     </strong>
     item for any schoolchild, now they're the bargain bucket item in a discount shop or worse still, trash filling up our landfill sites! What crazes have you been addicted to?
