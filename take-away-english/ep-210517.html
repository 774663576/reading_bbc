     Should you eat to live or live to eat?... a question posed by French playwright Moliere in his work ‘The Miser’. While eating is functional, and our bodies need the
     <strong>
      fuel
     </strong>
     that food provides,
     <strong>
      dining
     </strong>
     with friends or loved ones can be a wonderful experience. However, some of us often find ourselves
     <strong>
      reserving
     </strong>
     a table for one in a restaurant. But is dining alone really that bad? Maybe not.
    </p>
    <p>
     We all have foods we like and dislike. Maybe it’s a
     <strong>
      pungent
     </strong>
     cheese or
     <strong>
      stinky
     </strong>
     fish. We sometimes hold back on things that may offend the noses of others. When dining alone, we can
     <strong>
      consume
     </strong>
     whatever we like, with the added bonus that we might be able to eat more healthily. Often, if you want a salad and your significant other wants some less healthy
     <strong>
      cuisine
     </strong>
     , you end up
     <strong>
      ordering
     </strong>
     the same. And if you don’t get the same, you might end up with
     <strong>
      food envy
     </strong>
     as you watch someone
     <strong>
      chow down
     </strong>
     on a pizza while you’re left holding the lettuce.
    </p>
    <p>
     Have you ever spent too long debating with people which restaurant to eat in or when to meet? If
     <strong>
      dining solo
     </strong>
     , you can make the choice depending on your
     <strong>
      culinary
     </strong>
     desires at that moment and get your
     <strong>
      nourishment
     </strong>
     at exactly the time you’re hungry! And why does it have to be a restaurant? You could eat in a park, garden or even your bed – the point is, the choice is yours! That alone time also means it’s a time to switch off. According to psychologist Sherrie Bourg Carter, a bit of solitude can help your brain to unwind and may help you concentrate more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, for some, dining alone can be a necessity. For those of us who suffer from misophonia, a hatred of sound, that can in some cause PTSD, the noise of someone else
     <strong>
      masticating
     </strong>
     can be unbearable. Eating alone can save you from the extreme anxiety that may arise listening to someone
     <strong>
      smack their lips
     </strong>
     or the sloshing of
     <strong>
      saliva
     </strong>
     in their mouths! So, is eating alone bad? Well, it may not be for everyone, but there certainly are some benefits to it. Try it sometime – you might just like it!
