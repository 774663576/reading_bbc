     Do you like somewhere a little bit different to the usual types of places you find on the
     <strong>
      high street
     </strong>
     ?  I do, so I'm glad to see new ones popping up everywhere in London.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The so called
     <strong>
      pop-up shop
     </strong>
     is a temporary arrangement. In the
     <strong>
      aftermath
     </strong>
     of the financial crisis of 2008, many businesses had to
     <strong>
      shut down
     </strong>
     . Shops,
     <strong>
      warehouses
     </strong>
     and offices were left
     <strong>
      vacant
     </strong>
     when they stopped
     <strong>
      trading
     </strong>
     . Pop-up entrepreneurs occupied some of them quickly. For them the appeal of this temporary shopping concept is clear: they can start a business with much lower risk. The temporary nature of a pop-up gives the opportunity to test a product and develop a
     <strong>
      customer base
     </strong>
     , without being tied in to a long-term
     <strong>
      renting contract
     </strong>
     . Being small makes it much easier for pop-ups to
     <strong>
      expand
     </strong>
     if they are successful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pop-up shops first appeared in the UK in the early 2000s, with the economy
     <strong>
      booming
     </strong>
     . They were originally a way for small,
     <strong>
      niche
     </strong>
     companies to rent
     <strong>
      retail space
     </strong>
     in great locations. This was while
     <strong>
      landlords
     </strong>
     who owned these spaces looked for permanent
     <strong>
      tenants
     </strong>
     .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Pop-up shops can take a number of different forms. They might be temporary shops in the high street or a shopping centre. They might be simple
     <strong>
      market stalls.
     </strong>
     They could be based in some kind of transport, like a food truck. Or they could be run by people who visit different
     <strong>
      establishments
     </strong>
     , like travelling chefs who take over pub and restaurant kitchens temporarily.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     According to a 2014 report by the Centre of Economic and Business Research, the pop-up industry was worth £2.1bn and is expected to grow by 8.4% this year.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Almost anything that can be on a high street can also be a pop-up. There have been pop-up shops, art galleries, theatres and restaurants among others. In an age of fast-changing habits, the pop-up idea might be here to stay.

       False. Pop-ups actually started when the economy was doing well, or 'booming'. They were set up by niche companies so people could set up shops for specific markets.
