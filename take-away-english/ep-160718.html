     Britain is on the go-to list for tourists worldwide but, with the value of the pound reaching historic lows after the
     <strong>
      Brexit
     </strong>
     vote, a visit has became more
     <strong>
      timely
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The summer is a great time to be in Britain.
     <strong>
      The British Museum
     </strong>
     , the Natural History Museum, the Tate Gallery are all a
     <strong>
      must-see
     </strong>
     for everybody who comes to the country, but there's also a lot of interesting things to do for those who love the
     <strong>
      outdoors
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The Notting Hill Carnival
     </strong>
     changes the face of the famous London borough in the last weekend of August. It's the largest
     <strong>
      street festival
     </strong>
     in Europe. First held in 1964, it's a celebration of
     <strong>
      Caribbean
     </strong>
     culture but now includes Brazilians, Africans, Europeans and anybody else who likes to dress colourfully and feels the
     <strong>
      urge
     </strong>
     to dance to the sound of a beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     With its
     <strong>
      popularity
     </strong>
     growing it's estimated that 50,000 performers will take part in the parade, attracting more than 1 million people over the weekend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside the capital there's also plenty to do. Early in August there's the
     <strong>
      Robin Hood Festival
     </strong>
     in Sherwood Forest Country Park, Nottinghamshire. The legendary characters of books and movies – Robin Hood and the evil Sheriff of Nottingham - can be found there amid
     <strong>
      jousting tournaments
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      comedy acts
     </strong>
     . For those into nature, there's always the forest to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     In mid-August, in Bristol, a city about 200km from London, the sky is filled with colour during its annual
     <strong>
      balloon
     </strong>
     fiesta. If the weather is good, more than 100 hot air balloons rise up from the Fiesta's site in Ashton Court.
    </p>
    <p>
     Britain is full of traditions and sometimes just stopping at a
     <strong>
      country pub
     </strong>
     for a beer or having
     <strong>
      cream tea
     </strong>
     in a small tea room can make a moment special. Just be careful where you end up, though.
     <strong>
      Coaches
     </strong>
     full of
     <strong>
      sightseers
     </strong>
     went to the small village of Kiddlington early this month. As the visitors were taking pictures of the houses and entering private gardens, the
     <strong>
      locals
     </strong>
     were taking pictures of them. To this day, nobody knows what the tourists were doing there. Always be sure where you are, and learn enough English to ask for directions. Have a nice holiday!
