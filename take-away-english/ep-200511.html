     当你需要知道一个外语单词时，你会怎么做？许多人会拿起智能手机，来翻译他们需要的单词。但是如果计算机出错了，怎么办？在非正式的场合中，犯个小错误，也许影响不大；但有时在正式的重要场合中，一旦出现翻译错误，被传播出去，后果可能不堪设想。科技在不断地进步，但机器翻译能比真人翻译更好吗？

     For me, it was bacon. There I was, standing in the streets of Medellin, Colombia, looking hungrily at a delicious empanada. The sign read 'queso y tocino'. Because I'd

     </strong>
     some essential Spanish
     <strong>
      vocabulary
     </strong>
     , I knew that 'queso' was cheese. But 'tocino'? I typed it into my smartphone

     app. What came back? 'Tocino'. I later learned that means 'bacon' in the local

     .

     Computer-assisted translation is popular. Google Translate, for example, is used by more than 500 million people. But while convenient and easy to use, they are hardly perfect. Now, dropping the odd
     <strong>
      expression
     </strong>
     now and again is hardly important on an informal
     <strong>
      conversational
     </strong>
     level – as might happen to a tourist on holiday. But in more formal circumstances, such as a medical or legal
     <strong>
      discussion
     </strong>
     , the wrong
     <strong>
      vernacular
     </strong>
     can be disastrous. So, can a computer translator ever equal a human?
    </p>
    <p>
     The technology has come a long way. These days, people can wear a 'translation earpiece'.  These pick up the foreign
     <strong>
      terminology
     </strong>
     and translate it directly to the wearer. Andrew Ochoa, chief executive of US start-up Waverly Labs, a producer of one such earpiece, says they work by 'combining a network of algorithms and
     <strong>
      speech
     </strong>
     -
     <strong>
      recognition
     </strong>
     technology'.  But they have limitations. Firstly, there's a delay while the phrase is translated. How long often depends on the connection strength. Secondly, they aren't able to communicate human
     <strong>
      sentiment
     </strong>
     well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Human conversation is
     <strong>
      subtler
     </strong>
     than just the words used. It has
     <strong>
      tone
     </strong>
     , attitude,
     <strong>
      nuance
     </strong>
     , for example. "If you want to create a relationship… you need a human translator to make it
     <strong>
      sound natural
     </strong>
     ," Zoey Cooper, brand and content director at Wordbank, a global marketing and translation agency, told the BBC.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while many professional translators do use computer-assisted translation tools to help them with the repetitive nature of translation,
     <strong>
      context
     </strong>
     is important. It might work well for a survey or instruction manual, but for important human-to-human speech, and for the time being at least, better to use a translator, or your message might get
     <strong>
      garbled
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      lost in translation
     </strong>
     .
