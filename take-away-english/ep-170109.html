     在英国，“朝九晚五的工作”这个说法指的是遵循正常办公时间的工作，其中数字“9”和“5”分别代表英国公司最普遍的上下班时间。但如今，很多企业通过将办公时间变得灵活化来让员工感到更轻松、自由。一家美国公司要求其全体员工必须从早上九点零六分开始准时上班，这是为什么呢？本集《随身英语》探讨这家企业实行的独特规定。

     What time do you start work? Do you prefer a
     <strong>
      leisurely
     </strong>
     start to the day, or are you an
     <strong>
      early bird
     </strong>
     who likes to get going
     <strong>
      at the crack of dawn
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     At one computer programming company in the US you have no such choice. Work begins at the same oddly specific time every day: 9.06am.
    </p>
    <p>
     In contrast to a more conventional 9am
     <strong>
      kick
     </strong>
     <strong>
      -
     </strong>
     <strong>
      off
     </strong>
     , employees in Pivotal Software’s 20 offices around the globe have to be at work and ready to go precisely six minutes later.
    </p>
    <p>
     At that time a cowbell is rung and employees gather for a brief stand-up meeting. After that it’s
     <strong>
      nose to the grindstone
     </strong>
     , with no other meetings or distractions throughout the working day. They
     <strong>
      steam on through
     </strong>
     until 6pm
     <strong>
      sharp
     </strong>
     , at which point everybody
     <strong>
      downs tools
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So what’s the reason behind this
     <strong>
      quirky
     </strong>
     timekeeping? Company CEO Rob Mee explains it’s about making his team of computer programmers as efficient as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I realised that programmers, if
     <strong>
      left to their own devices
     </strong>
     , may
     <strong>
      roll in
     </strong>
     at 10am,” he says.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We thought that if we made it 9am, developers
     <strong>
      psyching themselves up
     </strong>
     for the day would think, ‘well if it is 9am I’ll be late.’”
    </p>
    <p>
     He needed a little more
     <strong>
      leeway
     </strong>
     , but a starting time of 9.05am
     <strong>
      on the nose
     </strong>
     felt too rigidly precise – whereas 9.06am seemed “fun”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr Mee was also thinking of their stomachs. Lazier programmers who
     <strong>
      turned up
     </strong>
     around 10am would also often have missed breakfast. This meant they would be hungry by 11am and take an early lunch, leaving them with an
     <strong>
      interminably
     </strong>
     long working afternoon ahead. So he decided to provide breakfast as an extra incentive to get in to the office on time.
    </p>
    <p>
     The company’s approach to
     <strong>
      punctuality
     </strong>
     may seem
     <strong>
      nerdy
     </strong>
     , but Pivotal Software is in fact a highly successful company, valued at 20bn RMB. And Pivotal is not alone: Silicon Valley has long been associated with an alternative working culture. Google has ‘
     <strong>
      nap
     </strong>
     pods’ and meditation classes, while Netflix offers a year’s paid
     <strong>
      parental leave
     </strong>
     .
