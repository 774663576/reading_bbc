     How much
     <strong>
      empathy
     </strong>
     do you feel towards other people? If you saw someone fall off their bike in traffic, would you stop and help - or just walk away? Many people would
     <strong>
      give in
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      apathy
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      go about their business
     </strong>
     and just do nothing. So it was a big surprise when about 100
     <strong>
      bystanders
     </strong>
     got together recently to move a bus in east London to help a cyclist
     <strong>
      trapped
     </strong>
     under it. A video of the incident
     <strong>
      went viral
     </strong>
     on social media.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to Zoheb, a driver who stopped his car to take part in the rescue, about five people
     <strong>
      gathered
     </strong>
     to move the bus. He says: "There was no chance we could do it, it was more an invitation for other people to help, really."
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <strong>
      initiative
     </strong>
     paid off. Diners from nearby restaurants joined in. There wasn't much
     <strong>
      coordination
     </strong>
     but it didn't take long to develop a
     <strong>
      collective
     </strong>
     understanding of what the objective was.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Spontaneous
     </strong>
     <strong>
      collaboration
     </strong>
     among
     <strong>
      strangers
     </strong>
     doesn't happen often. People in a crowd are not sure what to do - they don't have a plan. It's one of the reasons bystanders often do nothing, according to Dr Mark Levine, professor of
     <strong>
      social psychology
     </strong>
     at Exeter University in Britain. "The presence of others can
     <strong>
      inhibit
     </strong>
     you from helping", he says.
    </p>
    <p>
     The key to positive group behaviour and
     <strong>
      intervention
     </strong>
     , Levine explains, "is building a sense of shared identity". Action has to be decided quickly, Levine says. "The longer you leave it, the harder it is to make a decision. If you don't immediately act then you kind of think 'Well, actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'."
    </p>
    <p>
     But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference. The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of
     <strong>
      solidarity
     </strong>
     .
