     你也许听说过 “九五后” 这个称谓。在西方很多国家，人们把出生于九十年代中叶后，2010年前的年轻人统称为 “Z世代”。有人认为，出生于互联网时代的他们对科技产物有着天生的敏锐感。你了解这代人吗？你同意这种用年龄归类的方式吗？《随身英语》探讨 “Z世代” 的特征，并介绍和 “年轻人” 有关的英语词汇。

     When were you born? If it was in the late nineties or early
     <strong>
      noughties
     </strong>
     , then you've been classified as being part of Generation Z. But what does that mean and is it necessary to group people according to their date of birth?
    </p>
    <p>
     People have always been defined by their
     <strong>
      generation
     </strong>
     . We had the
     <strong>
      baby boomers
     </strong>
     of the 1960s, followed by Generation X and then Generation Y, often referred to as
     <strong>
      millennials
     </strong>
     , and the'
     <strong>
      new kids on the block
     </strong>
     ' are Generation Z – aged between 16 and 22. It's easy to classify these young people as all being the same, sharing the same attitudes towards life – but is that fair?
    </p>
    <p>
     A survey by the BBC's youth radio channel, Radio One, found that people from Generation Z, informally called 'Z-ers', may be viewed by others as shallow digital natives, incapable of
     <strong>
      real-world
     </strong>
     friendships. But they actually view themselves as hardworking,
     <strong>
      entrepreneurial
     </strong>
     and about to change the world for the better. It's an
     <strong>
      ambitious
     </strong>
     aim.
    </p>
    <p>
     The previous generation, born between the mid-1980s and late 1990s - the millennials - were also thought to have these characteristics. But according to Hiral Patel, an analyst from Barclays, many people view this new generation as "mini-millennials" She told the BBC that Z-ers are different "they have their own set of values and preferences which consumer brands need to
     <strong>
      cater for
     </strong>
     . Our research found that Gen Z are
     <strong>
      tech-innate
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      hyper-informed
     </strong>
     consumers, and extremely
     <strong>
      savvy
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     It's true to say that technology is playing an important part in the lives of Generation Z, particularly in the area of social media. In fact they have not known life without it and using it to communicate, share ideas and campaign is
     <strong>
      second nature
     </strong>
     – it is their
     <strong>
      norm
     </strong>
     . It means they have more of a say on what we eat, drink and buy than any generation before them. These young people certainly need to be listened to by retailers and businesses – they are the people with
     <strong>
      time on their hands
     </strong>
     and money.
    </p>
    <p>
     But being a Z-er comes with
     <strong>
      pressure
     </strong>
     . One young person told the BBC survey "many people in Generation Z have
     <strong>
      mental health issues
     </strong>
     because they're unsure what the future will bring." The future always brings uncertainties but maybe there is pressure for this generation to be the most successful ever. If you're one of them, how do you feel about your future?
