     How's your
     <strong>
      eyesight
     </strong>
     ? From the moment we're born, our eyes grow, our
     <strong>
      vision
     </strong>
     becomes clearer and some of us will have normal or even
     <strong>
      20:20 vision
     </strong>
     . However, others will become
     <strong>
      short-sighted
     </strong>
     and end up
     <strong>
      wearing
     </strong>
     <strong>
      glasses
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      contact lenses
     </strong>
     to help them see everything clearly. And some experts claim that more of us will be wearing them in the future because of our lifestyle when we were younger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even today,
     <strong>
      optometrists
     </strong>
     are reporting a rise in short-sightedness – also called
     <strong>
      myopia
     </strong>
     – in children. The condition can be
     <strong>
      genetic
     </strong>
     , but it's also partly being blamed on a number of modern-day factors – particularly children staring at phone screens, computers and game consoles for long periods of time. It's believed myopia also makes them susceptible to
     <strong>
      secondary eye conditions
     </strong>
     such as
     <strong>
      glaucoma
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      retinal detachment
     </strong>
     and other
     <strong>
      visual impairments
     </strong>
     later in life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, children have had increased
     <strong>
      screen time
     </strong>
     due to lockdowns imposed during the Covid pandemic – it's been the only way to access education and communicate with others. But education generally could be blamed for the rise in myopia. Neema Ghorbani-Mojarrad, lecturer at the University of Bradford, told BBC Future website: "We suspect it is reading and spending more time indoors. Every year of education completed increases the expected amount of short-sightedness."
    </p>
    <p>
     The problem appears to be more severe in some Asian countries. Some experts say that in these places with huge educational success, children spend more time indoors studying. Therefore, it seems, spending more time outdoors could be good for children's eye health. The UK's College of Optometrists is suggesting parents should get their kids playing outside for two hours a day. Several scientific studies show this can prevent or stop the development of myopia.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's been a focus on using technology, such as
     <strong>
      laser surgery
     </strong>
     , for fixing myopia, but for children at least, it seems a dose of daylight and a break from the screen might be part of the solution.
     <strong>
      Opticians
     </strong>
     also recommend kids have regular
     <strong>
      eye tests
     </strong>
     to identify any problems before they become more severe.
