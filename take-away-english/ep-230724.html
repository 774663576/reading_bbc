     季节会影响我们的睡眠吗？根据最新研究，答案是肯定的。本期节目介绍我们的睡眠模式是如何演变而成的，以及光和温度是否会对睡眠时间产生影响。

     After a long winter, the arrival of spring can be a welcome
     <strong>
      relief
     </strong>
     . The days grow longer, the temperatures increase, and the natural world around us
     <strong>
      comes to life
     </strong>
     again. But when the seasons change, our
     <strong>
      sleep patterns
     </strong>
     change with them.
    </p>
    <p>
     New research suggests that humans may need more sleep in the winter than they do in the summer. A German study found that participants slept an hour longer in December than in June, regardless of their
     <strong>
      exposure
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     light. "Our study shows that even while living in an urban environment, with just
     <strong>
      artificial light
     </strong>
     , humans [experience]
     <strong>
      seasonal sleep
     </strong>
     ," says Dieter Kunz, one of the study's lead authors and head of the clinic of sleep and
     <strong>
      chronomedicine
     </strong>
     at St Hedwig Hospital in Berlin, Germany. The study found that the participants experienced seasonal
     <strong>
      variations
     </strong>
     in their
     <strong>
      rapid eye movement
     </strong>
     <strong>
      sleep
     </strong>
     , also known as REM sleep, as well as in their
     <strong>
      slow wave sleep
     </strong>
     , also known as
     <strong>
      deep sleep
     </strong>
     . REM sleep, which is when we dream and our heart rate increases, was 30 minutes longer in the winter than during the summer. Slow wave sleep, which is when our muscles are
     <strong>
      repaired
     </strong>
     , our
     <strong>
      immune system
     </strong>
     is strengthened and our memory is
     <strong>
      consolidated
     </strong>
     , was 30 minutes shorter in September than in February.
    </p>
    <p>
     But why do our bodies and brains need more
     <strong>
      rest
     </strong>
     at certain times of year? The answer could lie in our evolutionary past. That's according to Neil Stanley, who's a sleep expert at Sleep Station, an online provider of
     <strong>
      cognitive behavioural therapy
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      insomnia
     </strong>
     . "We have
     <strong>
      evolved
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      dark-light cycles
     </strong>
     , so when we wake up on a winter's morning and it's dark, our brain is going 'I can't do anything… there's no point
     <strong>
      leaping out of bed
     </strong>
     .'" Particularly in summer, temperature also plays a role – our bodies require a skin temperature of between 31-35 degrees centigrade [Celsius] for a good night's sleep, but this can be harder to control during the warmer months.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Of course, nowadays, it is our school and work times – not the Sun – that determine when we get up in the morning. But, as autumn approaches, it seems we now have a good excuse for an
     <strong>
      early night
     </strong>
     .

    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      False. Participants experienced seasonal variations in REM sleep, as well as in slow wave sleep.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. In total, how much longer do we need to sleep in winter compared to summer, according to the study?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      One hour. Both REM and slow wave sleep were 30 minutes longer in the winter months.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. How does our past influence our sleep patterns?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Humans evolved to dark-light cycles, says Neil Stanley.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Why can it be harder to sleep in the summer months?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Because our bodies require a skin temperature of between 31-35 degrees centigrade [Celsius] for a good night's sleep, and this can be harder to regulate when it's hot.
