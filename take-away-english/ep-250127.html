     许多人可能会认为极限运动爱好者们有些奇特甚至不可理喻。是什么促使人们冒着生命危险去尝试一项体育运动的呢？最新的研究逐渐开始打破人们的刻板印象，显示出极限运动爱好者并不仅仅是不计后果或者对肾上腺素飙升上瘾的人。本文讨论哪些因素在驱使着人们不断尝试极限运动。

     There are two types of people: those who would jump from a plane, hungry to
     <strong>
      feel the rush
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      adrenaline
     </strong>
     in those moments before the
     <strong>
      parachute
     </strong>
     opens up, and those who would rather not
     <strong>
      tempt fate
     </strong>
     , and instead find
     <strong>
      pleasure
     </strong>
     in remaining safely on firm ground, perhaps enjoying a nice view. An extreme sport is one where a small mistake could result in a serious injury, even death. What is it that separates extreme sports
     <strong>
      enthusiasts
     </strong>
     from others who prefer to avoid such activities?
    </p>
    <p>
     "There has to be something wrong with them." That's an assumption that many people, including researchers, have historically held. Why else would a person participate in sports such as
     <strong>
      base jumping
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      free solo climbing
     </strong>
     , which are characterised by such high risk? But Eric Brymer, behavioural scientist who studies the psychology of adventure, has met many extreme athletes in his career and challenges the view that they are all
     <strong>
      reckless thrill-seekers
     </strong>
     . "Most people were very careful and took years to develop their skills," he said. Many don't even consider their sports risky because they spend so much time minimising risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, a desire to manage risks was a trait identified in extreme athletes in a 2024 study called 'What factors explain extreme sport participation?'. The authors also found that athletes enjoyed feeling
     <strong>
      at one with nature
     </strong>
     and being part of a community of like-minded people. Another theme was a
     <strong>
      drive
     </strong>
     to succeed. In this sense, extreme athletes might not differ much from traditional athletes – they are all united in wanting that
     <strong>
      sense of achievement
     </strong>
     . Lastly, while many extreme athletes are thrill-seekers, others use extreme sports for
     <strong>
      emotion regulation
     </strong>
     . For those who struggle to confront their emotions, extreme sports can provide an
     <strong>
      outlet
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Alex Honnold is the first and currently only person to free solo climb El Capitan, a rock formation in Yosemite National Park, from base to
     <strong>
      summit
     </strong>
     . When asked why he free climbs, he said "I'm searching more for that feeling of having done something well and being deeply content – it's more than the quick hit of adrenaline. It's personal." You might not feel the need to free solo climb a massive rock face to feel fulfilled, but the feeling of achieving goals outside of our
     <strong>
      comfort zone
     </strong>
     is something many of us can relate to.
