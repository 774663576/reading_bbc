     Would you be good at managing a
     <strong>
      top-level
     </strong>
     sports team? Do you have the
     <strong>
      tactics
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      know-how
     </strong>
     to be the next Jurgen Klopp? Well, you can find out by playing fantasy sports!
    </p>
    <p>
     While
     <strong>
      football fans
     </strong>
     across the globe observe
     <strong>
      victories
     </strong>
     , losses and
     <strong>
      draws
     </strong>
     of real matches this season, over nine million people will play Premier Fantasy Football, according to the
     <strong>
      Premier League
     </strong>
     . And it’s not just football, but also baseball, basketball and cricket to name just a few fantasy sports you can join.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a fantasy league, you get an
     <strong>
      imaginary
     </strong>
     <strong>
      budget
     </strong>
     which you can spend on your
     <strong>
      squad
     </strong>
     , selecting any players that compete in the actual sport of your chosen league. Of course, better players cost more! As the real games
     <strong>
      play out
     </strong>
     , so does your
     <strong>
      fictional
     </strong>
     team.
    </p>
    <p>
     Doesn’t sound
     <strong>
      up your street
     </strong>
     ? You may well have been pressured into competing in a league against your friends or colleagues
     <strong>
      against your better judgment
     </strong>
     , but, according to research, playing fantasy sports can actually benefit you. Some people find they enjoy the
     <strong>
      camaraderie
     </strong>
     that comes with it even if they’re not a fan of the sport itself. In fact, a US Quantum Workplace survey found that co-workers who play in a fantasy league together,
     <strong>
      bond
     </strong>
     better. They scored more highly in teamwork and trust than those who play, but not with colleagues. Plus, friendly competition gives you something to chitchat over when enjoying a hard-earned rest!
    </p>
    <p>
     Other pros are the
     <strong>
      brain training
     </strong>
     you get along with the entertainment.
     <strong>
      Strategy
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      tactical
     </strong>
     <strong>
      decision-making
     </strong>
     , budgeting and
     <strong>
      navigating
     </strong>
     large amounts of data are just some skills you need to do well in this kind of game.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, get your team ready and good luck!
