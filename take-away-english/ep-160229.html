    <p>
     Are you
     <strong>
      addicted
     </strong>
     to computer games? Do you stay up all night playing them? There's no doubt that the excitement and
     <strong>
      sophistication
     </strong>
     of games these days makes them hard to put down. But should we worry about their effects on our health?
    </p>
    <p>
     We are
     <strong>
      spoilt for choice
     </strong>
     when it comes to gaming: You can
     <strong>
      role play
     </strong>
     – creating your own
     <strong>
      fantasy
     </strong>
     characters and stories, giving you a chance to step out of everyday life into an
     <strong>
      imaginary world
     </strong>
     . And there are shooting games where you can let out your anger and frustration in
     <strong>
      violent
     </strong>
     situations where you kill people with guns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Can these kinds of games really be fun and can being absorbed in
     <strong>
      virtual reality
     </strong>
     be good for us? Popular games like Grand Theft Auto have been blamed for everything from falling results at school to
     <strong>
      provoking
     </strong>
     acts of extreme violence. Internet safety advisor, Alan MacKenzie, thinks "many people understandably will just think that a game is just a game and not realising the
     <strong>
      explicit
     </strong>
     content that's in there".  He gives an example of the violence and
     <strong>
      sexualisation
     </strong>
     of women which he says is "wholly inappropriate for anybody, never mind children."
    </p>
    <p>
     Others will argue that gaming is a
     <strong>
      harmless
     </strong>
     form of entertainment. There is evidence that playing video games could actually be good for us. Some games are educational and using games
     <strong>
      consoles
     </strong>
     can help children learn good
     <strong>
      dexterity
     </strong>
     . Studies have also shown that the skills used in playing games can cause growth in certain areas of the brain, the ability to think in 3D and even improve our eyesight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Video gamers are also no longer just
     <strong>
      solitary
     </strong>
     creatures. For some, gaming is having a positive effect on their social lives with games like Halo and World of Warcraft often being played in groups. When your group works together to win the game, your
     <strong>
      sense of achievement
     </strong>
     is higher than when winning by yourself. So it seems today, gaming isn't just for
     <strong>
      geeks
     </strong>
     and if used in moderation we can all take part. What video games do you play and how do they make you feel?
