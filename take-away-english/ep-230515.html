     <strong>
      词汇：making decisions 作决定
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Life is full of
     <strong>
      choices
     </strong>
     , some
     <strong>
      inconsequential
     </strong>
     , some really
     <strong>
      significant
     </strong>
     . But sometimes it can be hard to make the correct one. What are the obstacles that stand between us and a
     <strong>
      good outcome
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of us just find it hard to
     <strong>
      decide
     </strong>
     . Alice Boyes, writing for Harvard Business Review, tells us this can be connected to
     <strong>
      perfectionism
     </strong>
     , where people attempt to find a
     <strong>
      perfect solution
     </strong>
     to any problem and are unable to move forward when they can't find one. It might seem that being
     <strong>
      indecisive
     </strong>
     would stop us making the right decision, but in fact it could actually help us make the correct ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Susan Krauss in Psychology Today reminds us that people often make bad decisions because they base them on
     <strong>
      preconceptions
     </strong>
     rather than the context in which things happen. She highlights a paper by researcher Iris Schneider which finds that indecisive people are more likely to look at different
     <strong>
      perspectives
     </strong>
     and use them to
     <strong>
      come to
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     better
     <strong>
      decision
     </strong>
     . So, it could be that a more significant
     <strong>
      barrier
     </strong>
     to making the best choice is our
     <strong>
      cognitive biases
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     David Robson, speaking to the BBC's Crowd Science, tells us that intelligence can sometimes stop people making the right decision. People sometimes use intelligence to invent
     <strong>
      justifications
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      irrational beliefs
     </strong>
     . He believes that
     <strong>
      humility
     </strong>
     is key to making a good decision. People who can accept that they might be wrong are more likely to consider different viewpoints. He is backed up on this by Jeff Bezos. Tech CEO Jason Fried recalls the Amazon founder saying how the people who were right a lot of the time were the people who often
     <strong>
      changed their minds
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, maybe rather than indecision, it might be intelligence and decisiveness, backed up by our biases that actually stop us making good choices. While humility and
     <strong>
      indecisiveness
     </strong>
     could help us pick the best option.
