     你喜欢学习吗？虽然有些人爱学习，但也有不少人觉得学习枯燥无味。研究表明，如果你觉得一个概念太难或太无聊，学起来也就会更困难。但是，我们生来就会学习，所以好好利用这个天生的能力吧！

      词汇：philomath 爱学问的人
     </strong>

    <p>
     Are you the kind of person who hated school? Or are you more like Michael Nicholson, who can't stop learning? He currently has 30 degrees including 22
     <strong>
      master's
     </strong>
     and a
     <strong>
      doctorate
     </strong>
     ! If you're also passionate about studying, you might be a philomath – a person who loves to learn and study. The word comes from Greek with 'phil' meaning 'a lover of' and 'math' meaning 'learning'.
    </p>
    <p>
     Humans are all philomaths to an extent – our brain is
     <strong>
      hardwired
     </strong>
     to be
     <strong>
      curious
     </strong>
     . We want to learn and understand, partly to make sense of the world but also because of something called
     <strong>
      neoteny
     </strong>
     . This is a term that refers to the
     <strong>
      juvenile
     </strong>
     <strong>
      characteristics
     </strong>
     of some animals, including humans, being
     <strong>
      retained
     </strong>
     into adulthood. One of these
     <strong>
      traits
     </strong>
     is
     <strong>
      neuroplasticity
     </strong>
     , which helps our brains stay flexible – this gives us the ability to learn throughout our lives. Many creatures which are
     <strong>
      genetically
     </strong>
     <strong>
      close
     </strong>
     to us, like
     <strong>
      primates
     </strong>
     , can't do this and only learn during their
     <strong>
      adolescence
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But for every person who loves learning, there are plenty who can't stand it. Lots of people remember their school days as being boring or even pointless.Why is this?
     <strong>
      Educational anthropologists
     </strong>
     have suggested that if a
     <strong>
      concept
     </strong>
     or idea is too
     <strong>
      complex
     </strong>
     or dull, it becomes harder to link old and new ideas together. If that's the case, we lose
     <strong>
      motivation
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      absorb
     </strong>
     less information. This negative experience of education at school may lead to people avoiding learning opportunities in later life.  ­
    </p>
    <p>
     So, don't let a bad educational experience prevent you learning something new as an adult.
     <strong>
      Evolution
     </strong>
     has made us
     <strong>
      lifelong learners
     </strong>
     , so take advantage of your biology and discover your inner philomath. Who knows what you could achieve?
