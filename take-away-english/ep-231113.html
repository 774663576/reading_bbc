    <p>
     Does work ever leave you feeling
     <strong>
      stuck in a rut
     </strong>
     with limited opportunities to be creative? To thrive, you might want to increase your brain's
     <strong>
      flexibility
     </strong>
     . But is this even possible, and if so, how?
    </p>
    <p>
     Most jobs require the ability to
     <strong>
      problem-solve
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      cope with
     </strong>
     challenges, at least to a certain extent. Imagine a teacher who has a new and very nervous student in their class. If that teacher is a flexible thinker, they will be able to
     <strong>
      adapt
     </strong>
     their classroom management, even if they haven't seen this situation before. According to Leonard Mlodinow, author of Elastic, flexible thinkers rely on
     <strong>
      idea generation
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      imagination
     </strong>
     – they are willing to
     <strong>
      experiment
     </strong>
     and take risks. "Elastic thinking is what you need when the
     <strong>
      circumstances
     </strong>
     change, and you are dealing with something new. It's not about following rules." Therefore, instead of following the
     <strong>
      typical
     </strong>
     procedure for inducting a new student, the teacher might
     <strong>
      come up with
     </strong>
     a
     <strong>
      tailored
     </strong>
     response, based on
     <strong>
      prediction
     </strong>
     and previous experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, how can you become a more flexible thinker? According to Dr Lisa Feldman Barrett, it's all about exercising the brain. One way of doing this, she says, is through
     <strong>
      exposure
     </strong>
     to a variety of experiences which make it easier to
     <strong>
      adjust
     </strong>
     to new situations. A lot of companies now consider flexible thinking in the workplace, especially when it comes to design. Workspaces may have couches where workers can lie down and relax, giving them the space to come up with and process new ideas. Mlodinow says it's very important to take time to
     <strong>
      daydream
     </strong>
     , listen to ideas and
     <strong>
      concepts
     </strong>
     you disagree with and spend time doing activities outside of your
     <strong>
      comfort zone
     </strong>
     . This will help you understand multiple points of view and therefore blossom in many different aspects of your career.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you want to make a change, you can become a flexible thinker too, with a little practice.
