     去年，英国宣布从2030年起禁止销售新的汽油和柴油汽车，这引起了人们的广泛关注。但是，说起来容易做起来难，全球汽车产业电动化还有很长的路要走。本文浅谈电动汽车存在的问题及可能的解决方案。

     We are all aware of the damaging
     <strong>
      pollution
     </strong>
     that’s created by driving
     <strong>
      petrol
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      diesel
     </strong>
     <strong>
      vehicles
     </strong>
     . Many of the world’s cities are clogged with
     <strong>
      traffic
     </strong>
     , creating
     <strong>
      fumes
     </strong>
     containing gases such as
     <strong>
      nitrogen oxides
     </strong>
     . The solution for a cleaner, greener future could be
     <strong>
      electric vehicles
     </strong>
     . But how optimistic should we be?
    </p>
    <p>
     There was much excitement last year when the UK government announced it will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030. But is that easier said than done? The road to global traffic being totally electric is still a long way off. Currently,
     <strong>
      battery life
     </strong>
     is an issue – a fully charged battery won’t take you as far as a full
     <strong>
      tank
     </strong>
     of petrol. There are also limited numbers of
     <strong>
      charging points
     </strong>
     to plug an EV into.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, technology is always improving. Some of the biggest tech companies, like Google and Tesla, are spending huge amounts of money developing electric cars. And most of the big car manufacturers are now making them too. Colin Herron, a consultant on low-carbon vehicle technology, told the BBC: “The big leap forward will come with solid state batteries, which will appear first in mobile phones and laptops before they progress to cars.” These will charge more quickly and give cars a bigger
     <strong>
      range
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Cost is another issue that may deter people switching to
     <strong>
      electric power
     </strong>
     . But some countries offer incentives, such as cutting prices by reducing import taxes, and not charging for
     <strong>
      road tax
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      parking
     </strong>
     . Some also provide exclusive
     <strong>
      lanes
     </strong>
     for electric cars to be driven on, overtaking traditional cars which might be stuck in
     <strong>
      jams
     </strong>
     . These kinds of measures have made Norway the country with the most electric cars per capita at more than thirty electric cars per 1000 inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Colin Herron warns that ‘
     <strong>
      electric motoring
     </strong>
     ’ doesn’t mean a
     <strong>
      zero-carbon
     </strong>
     future. “It’s
     <strong>
      emission-free
     </strong>
     motoring, but the car has to be built, the battery has to be built, and the electricity does come from somewhere.” Maybe it’s time to think about making fewer journeys or using
     <strong>
      public transport
     </strong>
     .

     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. What are needed to recharge the batteries in electric vehicles?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Charging points are needed to recharge the batteries in electric vehicles.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. True or false?
     <em>
      According to Colin Herron, putting solid-state batteries in electric cars first will be a ‘great leap forward’.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      False. He says
     </strong>
     <strong>
      :
     </strong>
     <strong>
      “
     </strong>
     <strong>
      The big leap forward will come with solid state batteries, which
     </strong>
     <strong>
      w
     </strong>
     <strong>
      ill appear first in mobile phones and laptops before they progress to cars.”
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Why might electric cars not get stuck in traffic jams in the future?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because, in some places, they will be allowed to drive in exclusive lanes, overtaking traditional cars
     </strong>
     <strong>
      which might be
     </strong>
     <strong>
      stuck in traffic jams.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Will driving an EV be emission-free?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Driving an EV will be emission-free. However, the car, the battery, as well as producing the electricity that powers the car, could all create emissions. So electric motoring does not mean a zero-carbon future.
