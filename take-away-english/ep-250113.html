     图瓦卢希望成为世界上首个数字化的国家 “digital country”。图瓦卢位于夏威夷和澳大利亚之间，由多个礁岛和环礁共同组成。由于海平面上涨，许多图瓦卢居民都不得不离开自己的家园。图瓦卢政府希望通过记录和保存历史文件、地图、传统音乐和其他信息在互联网上重建这个国家。然而，将一个国家完全迁移到互联网上依然存在着许多问题。本文讨论数字化国家面临的挑战。

     Tuvalu, the fourth smallest nation in the world, announced its intention to become the world's first digital country back in 2022. But why, and how?
    </p>
    <p>
     Facing the devastating effects of rising sea levels caused by climate change, the nation, made up of three
     <strong>
      reef
     </strong>
     <strong>
      islands
     </strong>
     and six
     <strong>
      atolls
     </strong>
     , is rapidly becoming
     <strong>
      uninhabitable
     </strong>
     . Tuvalu sits between Hawaii and Australia and is
     <strong>
      grappling
     </strong>
     <strong>
      with
     </strong>
     increasingly dire conditions. In 2022, at
     <strong>
      high
     </strong>
     <strong>
      tide
     </strong>
     , nearly 40% of the capital became
     <strong>
      submerged
     </strong>
     , according to the news agency Reuters. A recent assessment by scientists at NASA indicated that "much of the land plus
     <strong>
      critical
     </strong>
     <strong>
      infrastructure
     </strong>
     will sit below the level of the current high tide by 2050". And projections suggest the entire country could be
     <strong>
      underwater
     </strong>
     by the year 2100. Global warming has already
     <strong>
      displaced
     </strong>
     many of Tuvalu's 11,000 inhabitants, while
     <strong>
      coral
     </strong>
     <strong>
      bleaching
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      coastal
     </strong>
     <strong>
      erosion
     </strong>
     continue to
     <strong>
      degrade
     </strong>
     the surrounding environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is why the government plans to
     <strong>
      back
     </strong>
     <strong>
      up
     </strong>
     the country and rebuild a
     <strong>
      virtual
     </strong>
     online
     <strong>
      replica
     </strong>
     . The announcement was first made at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP27 by Tuvalu's Minister of Justice, Simon Kofe. He said, "As our land
     <strong>
      slips
     </strong>
     <strong>
      below
     </strong>
     the ocean, we have no choice but to become the world's first digital nation. Our land, our ocean, our culture are the most precious assets of our people".
    </p>
    <p>
     The country has since been
     <strong>
      preserving
     </strong>
     Tuvalu's cultural and historical identity by recording historical documents, maps, family photograph albums, traditional songs, and other cultural practices, all of which will be accessible online. In early 2024, Place, a global non-profit organisation, began
     <strong>
      mapping
     </strong>
     the physical features of Funafuti, Tuvalu's capital, using drones and 360-degree cameras.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though moving a country online has legal challenges – international law requires a country to have
     <strong>
      territory
     </strong>
     and population, both of which are uncertain in Tuvalu's future. At the same time, critics argue the plan is just for publicity, highlighting the need to reduce
     <strong>
      emissions
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever happens, a digital twin of the country will help preserve its culture and heritage for generations to come.
