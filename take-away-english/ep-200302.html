     现如今，在条件允许的情况下，越来越多的人选择在家工作。人们向往现代化的生活，渴望工作与生活的平衡。与此同时，科技不断发展，在家里办公变得轻而易举。但是，所有人都适合在家工作吗？本文讨论传统工作模式的革新。

     If you go to work, you’re probably familiar with the
     <strong>
      routine
     </strong>
     of travelling to the office, hunting for an available desk, completing your
     <strong>
      tasks
     </strong>
     and then enduring your
     <strong>
      commute
     </strong>
     home. In many ways, it seems like an outdated working practice. And maybe that’s why more and more of us are now choosing to work from home.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are, of course, many reasons for
     <strong>
      remote working
     </strong>
     , as it is also called. The demands of modern life and a desire for a better
     <strong>
      work-life balance
     </strong>
     has driven the trend, along with improved technology, which makes doing most tasks at home a
     <strong>
      doddle
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     In the UK, figures from the Office for National Statistics show more than one and a half million people work from home for their main job. But, although
     <strong>
      logging on
     </strong>
     from the comfort of your sofa may appeal, especially if it’s part of a
     <strong>
      flexible working
     </strong>
     approach, some people are forced to work from home and find it
     <strong>
      hard going
     </strong>
     . Marketing consultant Mark Black told the BBC he struggled to
     <strong>
      switch off
     </strong>
     from work when he was based solely at home. He says: "I hated home working. You get up in the morning and stare at the same four walls, do your work, and try and
     <strong>
      clock off
     </strong>
     , but you can't." It’s true that being at home means you can’t physically leave your office behind, and as Emma Mamo from mental health charity Mind says: "Home workers don't always have the same opportunities to connect with people as their office-based
     <strong>
      colleagues
     </strong>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     But remote working doesn’t always mean being at home. Cafes and workplace spaces offer a chance for workers, particularly
     <strong>
      self-employed
     </strong>
     people, to come together and
     <strong>
      interact with
     </strong>
     each other. There are also employees who have no choice but to work remotely because their companies have decided to do away with offices altogether to have a more
     <strong>
      agile
     </strong>
     workforce - it's certainly very
     <strong>
      cost effective
     </strong>
     and attractive for
     <strong>
      start-ups
     </strong>
     . But for those employed by businesses with a physical base, working at home provides a convenient alternative to the 9 to 5. And without the
     <strong>
      distraction
     </strong>
     of their colleagues, it can be the most
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     place to work!
