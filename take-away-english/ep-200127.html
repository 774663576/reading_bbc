     以前，一些学生为了能去旅行一年而推迟上大学。但现在的重点是做一个有成效、有明确目标的间隔年，让这一年给你的简历增亮添彩，帮助你申请到称心如意的大学课程，并最终找到一份好工作。这是个好主意吗？本期内容讨论暂时休学的好处。

     When you’ve finished your studies at school and college, do you feel like a well-earned rest? If you’re about to embark on a course at university, you’ll want to
     <strong>
      recharge your batteries
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      let your hair down
     </strong>
     and have some fun. But how long should you do that for? Now the idea of taking a year off before you move into
     <strong>
      further education
     </strong>
     seems to be the thing to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     A year off – also called a
     <strong>
      gap year
     </strong>
     – is not a new concept, but there’s now a focus on making the most of this break from
     <strong>
      academic life
     </strong>
     . Long gone are the days of just hanging out on a beach or backpacking round the world. While that is still an option, a gap year is now more about gaining skills that will help you in later life. The BBC’s Smart Consumer podcast spoke to a student called Meg, who said “I just always had in the back of my mind I'd spend a year doing something
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     and something that would just be good fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Doing something productive is exactly what students are being encouraged to do because doing more
     <strong>
      purposeful
     </strong>
     things like
     <strong>
      work experience
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      charity work
     </strong>
     helps them acquire skills to use when competing for a place at university. It looks good on their CV and ultimately makes them more
     <strong>
      employable
     </strong>
     . Chris Rea is a Higher Education Services Manager from organisation, Prospects. He told the BBC that he thinks “the experience of the gap year has become actually much more
     <strong>
      practical
     </strong>
     , partly to do with university participation increasing, but also because of the demands on developing skills, specifically employability skills.”
    </p>
    <p>
     While the benefits of taking a gap year are clear to see, some students worry they can’t afford it. Another student, Tom, told the BBC that to him, a gap year was an ‘
     <strong>
      alien concept
     </strong>
     ’. He said “it would have been far too expensive and it's not something that I would have been able to rely on my parents or family members for.” But some experts say that it needn’t
     <strong>
      burn a hole in your pocket
     </strong>
     ; you don’t need to travel far and you can even earn money by doing paid work.
    </p>
    <p>
     For those who do have the funds, a combination of working,
     <strong>
      volunteering
     </strong>
     and travelling is undoubtedly an amazing opportunity. It increases
     <strong>
      confidence
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      independence
     </strong>
     , gives you a chance to learn new
     <strong>
      crafts
     </strong>
     , and gives you time to
     <strong>
      contemplate
     </strong>
     whether university is right for you.
