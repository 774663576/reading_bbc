     Are you a
     <strong>
      movie­goer
     </strong>
     ? If, like me, you’re a fan of film, then there’s no better place to watch something than on
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      big screen
     </strong>
     at the
     <strong>
      cinema
     </strong>
     . You enter the dark
     <strong>
      auditorium
     </strong>
     and take your seat, ready to be entertained. But while you
     <strong>
      engross
     </strong>
     yourself in some movie magic, many others are now getting their
     <strong>
      film fix
     </strong>
     at home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Over the last few years, cinemas have seen a resurgence. Customers have been enticed by comfortable seats, and lots of choice of things to watch.
     <strong>
      Multiplexes
     </strong>
     in particular can
     <strong>
      screen
     </strong>
     up to twenty films at the same time, catering for all different tastes. In addition, 3D and even 4D movies can give the
     <strong>
      audience
     </strong>
     an extra
     <strong>
      immersive
     </strong>
     <strong>
      experience
     </strong>
     . So, what’s not to like about a trip to the cinema?
    </p>
    <p>
     One answer to that question is convenience. Rather than going out, it’s so much easier to stay in and watch a
     <strong>
      romcom
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      action movie
     </strong>
     on a
     <strong>
      high-definition
     </strong>
     TV screen via a
     <strong>
      streaming service
     </strong>
     such as Netflix or Amazon Prime. There’s plenty of choice, and it’s relatively cheap as well. But, personally, I find there are too many distractions, and watching at home is not such an event. I miss the
     <strong>
      trailers
     </strong>
     too!
    </p>
    <p>
     But the coronavirus pandemic has put the future of cinemas under the spotlight. Some have had to close because of reduced ticket sales.  And in the UK, it’s brought about a surge in TV watching and
     <strong>
      online streaming
     </strong>
     , according to media watchdog, Ofcom. It also found that half of UK adults will keep and continue using their new streaming
     <strong>
      subscriptions
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     This isn’t great news for cinemas. They rely on the
     <strong>
      release
     </strong>
     of a big
     <strong>
      blockbuster
     </strong>
     to bring the crowds back, but the launch of new films, such as James Bond: No Time To Die, are being delayed. And Disney has released its $200m blockbuster, Mulan, online instead of in
     <strong>
      movie theatres
     </strong>
     . But John Fithian, from the National Association of Theatre Owners, told Variety magazine: “This idea of waiting out the pandemic to make your movies more profitable doesn’t make sense to me. There won’t be as much of an industry left to play your movies in if you do that.”
