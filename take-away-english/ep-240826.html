     Think about the
     <strong>
      crunch
     </strong>
     of celery, mixed with a smooth,
     <strong>
      creamy
     </strong>
     tzatziki or the
     <strong>
      tang
     </strong>
     of a
     <strong>
      spicy
     </strong>
     salsa piled on top of a
     <strong>
      crispy
     </strong>
     corn tortilla chip. Is anything more
     <strong>
      satisfying
     </strong>
     to eat than a dip?
    </p>
    <p>
     Dips have become big business. In 2022, over £263 million pounds were spent on dips, just in the UK. Why is it that we like them so much? Food writer Ben Paynter cites studies showing that modern restaurants use cooking techniques that can leave food seeming dry, but that sauces and dips can replace the lost
     <strong>
      moisture
     </strong>
     . Some studies have even suggested, that the
     <strong>
      liquid nature
     </strong>
     of dips and sauces brings
     <strong>
      flavours
     </strong>
     into contact with more of our
     <strong>
      taste buds
     </strong>
     , intensifying them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our love for dips could be driven by
     <strong>
      positive associations
     </strong>
     . Dips are designed
     <strong>
      to be
     </strong>
     <strong>
      shared
     </strong>
     and eaten without
     <strong>
      cutlery
     </strong>
     , they can feel more
     <strong>
      communal
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      informal.
     </strong>
     Diners may associate them with happy social occasions. British food writer Clare Finney points out that when dips first became popular in the UK, people may have related them to popular holiday destinations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Communal shared eating may be good for our mental health, but what do dips do to our physical health?
     <strong>
      Dieticians
     </strong>
     have raised different arguments. One considers that dips encourage people to include more vegetables in their diet. The opposing argument is that dips can be high in
     <strong>
      saturated fat
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      calories
     </strong>
     , and salt. Many dips have small
     <strong>
      recommended portion sizes
     </strong>
     , but that doesn't mean that people follow this guidance. One US study found that 48% of those surveyed admitted to finishing an entire container in one sitting. Djin Gie Liem, a
     <strong>
      sensory science
     </strong>
     professor, points out that people are less likely to become accustomed to the taste of healthy food if they only eat it covered in sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dips can bring good social times to mind and give us intense flavours. Maybe we just need to pay a little bit more attention to the suggested portion sizes.
