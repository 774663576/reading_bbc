      词汇：emotional intelligence 情商

    <p>
     According to research studies coming out of top US universities, having high emotional intelligence, or EQ, can help you to succeed, particularly at work.
    </p>
    <p>
     The idea of emotional intelligence was introduced by
     <strong>
      psychologist
     </strong>
     John Mayer in the 90s and has gained
     <strong>
      popularity
     </strong>
     since, especially because it is said to be something that you can improve. Someone with high emotional intelligence can supposedly
     <strong>
      build strong relationships
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      achieve
     </strong>
     their
     <strong>
      goals
     </strong>
     and manage their emotions – key areas for success in most jobs!
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s likely that, during your career, you will need to work in a team. A 2020 Harvard study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, investigated
     <strong>
      social skills
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      team players
     </strong>
     . They did this by
     <strong>
      grouping
     </strong>
     volunteers and giving them a variety of
     <strong>
      tricky
     </strong>
     problems. They then compared the top individual
     <strong>
      performers
     </strong>
     . Results showed two main reasons why these individuals
     <strong>
      excelled
     </strong>
     , both linked to emotional intelligence. The first reason was that they were very good at recognising the emotional
     <strong>
      state
     </strong>
     of their teammates. The second was that they helped to improve their team’s performance through
     <strong>
      motivation
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     When researching links between
     <strong>
      emotion-understanding ability
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      risk-taking
     </strong>
     , a 2012 Yale study found emotional intelligence to be
     <strong>
      critical
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      decision making
     </strong>
     . Researchers investigated the way that leaders come to a decision when they are
     <strong>
      under pressure
     </strong>
     . The results revealed that participants with a high
     <strong>
      awareness
     </strong>
     of why they felt under pressure managed to keep a
     <strong>
      clearer
     </strong>
     head and were less likely to take risks. Being able to understand and manage emotions is a key part of EQ.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you’re trying to succeed, work on your emotional intelligence and it may just make a difference!
