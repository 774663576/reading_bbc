     When's it's time for a wardrobe
     <strong>
      makeover
     </strong>
     , who's the best person to give you some advice? You'll probably turn to your friend for some feedback and fashion
     <strong>
      tips
     </strong>
     – let's face it: they know you best and can offer an honest opinion about which colours
     <strong>
      clash
     </strong>
     – and which outfit makes you
     <strong>
      look a million dollars
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However for someone like me, who's not a follower of fashion and has a more practical
     <strong>
      dress sense
     </strong>
     , I don't need help - it's just jeans or… jeans! But for people who care about their
     <strong>
      appearance
     </strong>
     , they can now get some trustworthy advice with the aid of technology.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, using social media is a good way to discuss fashion
     <strong>
      dilemmas
     </strong>
     with your friends, but this sometimes brings in too much conflicting advice - and opinions that are sometimes
     <strong>
      brutal
     </strong>
     ! That's why one woman has developed an app to help women crowdsource advice from
     <strong>
      stylists
     </strong>
     and sister
     <strong>
      fashionistas
     </strong>
     in a safe,
     <strong>
      troll-free
     </strong>
     environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sophia Matveeva's Style Counsel app allows users wanting advice on an outfit to post a photo and receive "yes" or "no" answers from other users, or more detailed advice from
     <strong>
      vetted
     </strong>
     fashion stylists and bloggers very quickly. According to Matthew Wall, BBC Technology of Business editor, this is a growing business, with several new apps such as AskAnna, Mallzee and StyleDotMe all offering young women tips on suitable and fashionable clothes to wear.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's also a website called EyeFitU which finds clothes to fit your
     <strong>
      figure
     </strong>
     . Its chief executive, Isabelle Ohnemus, says there are no international standards in clothes sizes but she explains "We can set up your size profile in a few seconds with 80% accuracy just knowing your gender, height, weight and age". This information is used to search different
     <strong>
      retailers
     </strong>
     and find clothes that suit your actual shape. And the internet giant, Amazon, has also developed a camera that links to a '
     <strong>
      style check
     </strong>
     ' function that compares photos and gives its
     <strong>
      algorithmically-derived
     </strong>
     opinion of which outfit is better, based on fit, colour, style and current fashion
     <strong>
      trends
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But does technology make fashion advice a bit impersonal? Sophia Matveeva admits that women in particular are social creatures and that "AI will never stop us talking to each other… girls will always want the approval of the
     <strong>
      cool girl
     </strong>
     at school." But as for me: an app with someone I don't know could be the place to start with some discreet fashion tips!
