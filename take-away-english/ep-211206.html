     What’s your favourite genre of film? For many people who love being
     <strong>
      petrified
     </strong>
     , or
     <strong>
      scared out of their wits
     </strong>
     , by
     <strong>
      jump scares
     </strong>
     that answer will be horror. Whether it’s splatter films,
     <strong>
      wastelands
     </strong>
     in the
     <strong>
      apocalypse
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      monsters
     </strong>
     like
     <strong>
      demons
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      zombies
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      vampires
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      werewolves
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      phantoms
     </strong>
     , there’s something to suit everyone’s taste. But just why do people enjoy watching these
     <strong>
      terrifying
     </strong>
     films?
    </p>
    <p>
     First off, being scared can give us a
     <strong>
      rush
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of
     </strong>
     <strong>
      adrenaline
     </strong>
     . The heart starts pumping, making these films
     <strong>
      exhilarating
     </strong>
     . But the fact you’re actually at home safe on the sofa makes the experience of being
     <strong>
      frightened
     </strong>
     all the more enjoyable because what’s happening to the characters on the screen is far removed from your experience of being in your living room eating popcorn. It feels more
     <strong>
      thrilling
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Coltan Scrivner, a PhD candidate in the Department of Comparative Human Development at The University of Chicago, argues that people who watch horror films learn how to regulate their anxiety. A study that he co-authored found that horror fans exhibited greater resilience during the early stages on the Covid-19 pandemic than those who didn’t.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, some horror fans think they could survive the events on screen. That gives those viewers a sense of superiority. We often mock the typical
     <strong>
      tropes
     </strong>
     of horror films. Why do they try to escape the
     <strong>
      masked
     </strong>
     killer by running upstairs and confining themselves? The characters often make terrible decisions that lead to their deaths – decisions we as viewers believe we wouldn’t make.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, whether it’s to help people regulate their anxiety, be thrilled by getting scared, or to feel superior mocking the decisions of the characters, there are many reasons people love watching horror films – and if they really scare you, maybe it’s best to watch them with the lights on.
