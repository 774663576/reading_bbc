     数百年来，硬币和钞票一直是人类进行商品交易的主要方式。在英国，自借记卡和信用卡被发明以来，现金的使用已不如以往那样普遍。2017 年，使用现金交易的金额的总数低于借记卡支付的交易金额。这难道意味着我们离现金时代的消亡不远了？借记卡会变成未来唯一的交易方式吗？所有人都认可这种交易方式吗？《随身英语》带你展望无现金社会的种种可能。

     <strong>
      Cash is king
     </strong>
     , or so they say. In one form or another, human beings have been carrying around money for hundreds of years. Metal was first
     <strong>
      coined
     </strong>
     into
     <strong>
      cash
     </strong>
     between 700 and 600 BC by the Lydians, and
     <strong>
      banknotes
     </strong>
     have been
     <strong>
      in circulation
     </strong>
     since their first use in China around 1000 AD. These days, though, habits have changed. Modern technology means that while money is still widely used, it's more likely to be a digital
     <strong>
      transaction
     </strong>
     than a
     <strong>
      wad
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of notes
     </strong>
     and a handful of
     <strong>
      shrapnel
     </strong>
     . If cash is king, then it may eventually be dethroned.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the UK, the use of tangible
     <strong>
      currency
     </strong>
     is in decline. In 2017, the banking trade body UK Finance reported a 15% fall in the use of
     <strong>
      ready money
     </strong>
     . Since their first use, debit card payments have
     <strong>
      given
     </strong>
     cash
     <strong>
      a run for its money
     </strong>
     . Last year, for the first time ever, the use of debit cards and
     <strong>
      contactless payments
     </strong>
     became the most popular way to
     <strong>
      stump up
     </strong>
     . In fact, if trends continue, the use of
     <strong>
      cold hard cash
     </strong>
     , would end by 2026, says the report.
    </p>
    <p>
     For businesses,
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      smart money is
     </strong>
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     not taking cash. By doing so, they are
     <strong>
      in the money
     </strong>
     . For example, the Boot pub in Freston opened last year as a
     <strong>
      cashless
     </strong>
     pub. In a BBC article, its owner Mike Keen lists several advantages, including a quicker speed of service, lower insurance premiums since no cash is kept on site, and a saving in time as he needn't
     <strong>
      cash up
     </strong>
     each day nor
     <strong>
      make a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      deposit
     </strong>
     in the bank several times each week.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, eight million people in the UK still need cash, according to the Access to Cash Review, an independent body measuring the need for cash in the UK. Those living in rural areas with poor internet connectivity and people who have physical or mental health issues are among those that find it difficult to use digital services. In addition, many service providers, such as window cleaners, are still paid
     <strong>
      cash in hand
     </strong>
     . Not to mention,
     <strong>
      budgeting
     </strong>
     , which is easier with cash since "you know what you've got," interviewee Kev Jackson told the BBC.
    </p>
    <p>
     Is cash dead? Not yet it would seem, though as more technological solutions to payment, such as smart watches, become commonplace, its use is likely to decline more. What's important is, the report concludes, to put in place infrastructure to ensure that those who still need to pay the good, old-fashioned way can
     <strong>
      get their money's worth
     </strong>
     .
