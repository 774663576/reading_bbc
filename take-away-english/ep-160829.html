      词汇: Evolution 进化

    <p>
     Compared to other large mammals on Earth, we humans have relatively little hair. This obvious fact is not so strange until we look at our closest living relatives in the animal kingdom – chimpanzees and other great apes. Why, might we ask, have we evolved to be almost hairless when all other
     <strong>
      primates
     </strong>
     are still covered in fur? In fact,
     <strong>
      bizarre
     </strong>
     as it may seem, our lack of hair has been the key to our evolutionary success as a
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The question why our earliest ancestors lost their hair when fur would have been beneficial to them – for keeping warm on cold nights, for example – was
     <strong>
      pondered
     </strong>
     by Charles Darwin, the famous
     <strong>
      evolutionist
     </strong>
     : "No one supposes that the
     <strong>
      nakedness
     </strong>
     of the skin is any direct advantage to man." He concluded that the reason
     <strong>
      hominins
     </strong>
     lost their hair was
     <strong>
      sexual
     </strong>
     <strong>
      selection
     </strong>
     . In other words, we prefer our partners to have little hair. But what caused our
     <strong>
      ancestors
     </strong>
     to start losing their hair before this preference set in?
    </p>
    <p>
     The most likely
     <strong>
      hypothesis
     </strong>
     to explain the loss of hair is that it became necessary when early
     <strong>
      hominids
     </strong>
     moved to a more open
     <strong>
      savannah
     </strong>
     habitat around 2 to 3 million years ago, when they started to
     <strong>
      hunt
     </strong>
     big
     <strong>
      game
     </strong>
     .Hunting in open savannah meant being exposed to the strong heat of the sun for several hours in the day and being in danger of overheating. Being covered in hair prevented our ancestors from losing heat fast enough. So, as Peter Wheeler, of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK, explained, losing hair allowed them to develop the ability to sweat and therefore to cool down.
     <strong>
      Early humans
     </strong>
     could, as a consequence, be out at midday hunting and
     <strong>
      foraging
     </strong>
     . "It would be [an] enormous advantage to be able to spend the entire midday foraging,
     <strong>
      finding mates
     </strong>
     or fighting enemies", Tamás Dávid-Barrett of Oxford University says. "Sweating allows that, and for sweat to be efficient you need to be mostly hairless". The meat from hunting animals gave early humans the energy to fuel their growing brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Humans are the sweatiest primates on Earth. They have up to 5 million sweat
     <strong>
      glands
     </strong>
     ,which produce about 12 litres of sweat per day. It's this
     <strong>
      propensity
     </strong>
     to sweat that accounts for our hairlessness and has allowed us to
     <strong>
      thrive
     </strong>
     . It might help to remember this next time you're surrounded by sweaty hairless
     <strong>
      torsos
     </strong>
     in the gym!
