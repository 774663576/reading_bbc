     据说，路易十四曾经热衷于在他的宫殿里喷洒香水，以此来掩盖自己身上的气味。人体散发出的气味中其实隐藏了与其健康和基因有关的信息。比如，接受过特殊训练的狗仅仅通过闻气味就可能嗅出一些疾病。本文介绍你身上的气味能传递哪些与你有关的信息。

     Have you ever wondered what your unique
     <strong>
      body odour
     </strong>
     says about you? Turns out, quite a lot! From your health to your genetics, we can learn a lot from
     <strong>
      taking a whiff
     </strong>
     of your odour. Your
     <strong>
      scent
     </strong>
     is a complex mix of information, and we humans are pretty good at reading it. So, what secrets are revealed from our scent, and why do we mostly choose to ignore them?
    </p>
    <p>
     Researchers believe scent production is mostly determined by our genes. In a study published in Chem Senses by Craig Roberts and colleagues, participants had to match T-shirts that smelt the same after
     <strong>
      sniffing
     </strong>
     them. They matched the T-shirts of identical twins, meaning their scent was very similar, and those sniffing had quite an accurate
     <strong>
      sense of smell
     </strong>
     . Agnieszka Sorokowska, an expert in human
     <strong>
      olfaction
     </strong>
     , says this means "we might be able to detect genetic information about other people by smelling them."
    </p>
    <p>
     But it's not all about your genes. In another twin study called 'The Discrimination of Human Odour by the Dog', a dog could
     <strong>
      distinguish
     </strong>
     the odour of identical twins living apart. So, your environment can change how you smell, but it might take a dog’s sensitive nose to detect it. Even your health can change how you smell. In a study called 'The Scent of Disease', the
     <strong>
      BO
     </strong>
     of someone with diabetes was associated with rotten apples, while those with scurvy had sweat described as '
     <strong>
      putrid
     </strong>
     '. Odour research has also helped to train dogs to detect illnesses such as cancer by scent alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Do humans use any of this information? King Louis XIV of France was known to
     <strong>
      douse
     </strong>
     his palace in
     <strong>
      fragrance
     </strong>
     ,perhaps to mask the
     <strong>
      stench
     </strong>
     of poor
     <strong>
      personal hygiene
     </strong>
     . This trend continues today – many of us cover our natural body odour with sweet or floral-smelling
     <strong>
      perfumes
     </strong>
     , and in the process, we may be losing the opportunity to learn more about each other and the world. Maybe it's time to drop the
     <strong>
      deodorants
     </strong>
     and pleasant
     <strong>
      aroma
     </strong>
     of your favourite perfume and let your natural scent
     <strong>
      waft
     </strong>
     around, sending the signals that your body wants to
     <strong>
      emit
     </strong>
     .
