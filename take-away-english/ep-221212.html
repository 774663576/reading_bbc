     We've all been there – staring at a pile of books, desperately hoping that what we study will
     <strong>
      stick in our mind
     </strong>
     . Many of us have probably asked if there's any way that we can get better at remembering things. So, why don't we look at what memory experts say about this?
    </p>
    <p>
     Every student who has made
     <strong>
      flashcards
     </strong>
     knows that it can be helpful to
     <strong>
      go back over
     </strong>
     what they've studied before. According to The Learning Scientists – a group of
     <strong>
      cognitive
     </strong>
     scientists – we can learn things better if we wait for some time before trying to study them again. They say that trying to
     <strong>
      retrieve
     </strong>
     something from your memory after you have had some time to forget it will make it easier to remember in future.
    </p>
    <p>
     Similarly, David Robson, writing for BBC Future, highlights studies that show taking some time to just do nothing after studying might mean that you can remember things better afterwards. We don't know exactly why this happens, but it has been suggested that it's to do with the relationship between
     <strong>
      long-term
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      short-term
     </strong>
     <strong>
      memory
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Another
     <strong>
      study
     </strong>
     <strong>
      tip
     </strong>
     from The Learning Scientists is to change between different topics as you study. They say this can help you build links between different ideas. Now,
     <strong>
      linking
     </strong>
     ideas and
     <strong>
      relating
     </strong>
     them to each other or to images are often suggested as good ways to
     <strong>
      memorise
     </strong>
     something. Former world memory champion Jonathan Hancock highlights how
     <strong>
      picturing
     </strong>
     pieces of information in different physical locations or linking them to
     <strong>
      memorable images
     </strong>
     makes them easier to remember. Linking new information to things that are easier to remember is a technique that many people use – it could be making letter
     <strong>
      patterns
     </strong>
     into words called
     <strong>
      mnemonics
     </strong>
     , or by sorting things into categories.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are also more general things that we can do to improve our memory. Hancock says that being generally organised makes things easier for your brain, while many other experts also recommend avoiding stress, alcohol and smoking, and that we should get a lot of rest and exercise. So, the good news to take from this is that while it may be hard, improving our memory is something we can control.
