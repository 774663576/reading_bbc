     保持良好的个人卫生非常重要，洗澡则是清洁身体的最佳方式之一。不过，多久洗一次澡最合适？热水澡和冷水澡哪个更好？洗澡对健康有哪些好处？本期 “随身英语” 节目围绕洗澡这件日常必做之事展开讨论。

     <strong>
      Bath
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      shower
     </strong>
     ? How do you prefer to keep yourself clean? Whatever your daily
     <strong>
      ablutions
     </strong>
     , we know it’s important to have good
     <strong>
      personal hygiene
     </strong>
     . Nobody wants to smell, and nobody wants to catch your
     <strong>
      odour
     </strong>
     ! A shower can bring you certain other benefits, but how often should we
     <strong>
      wash
     </strong>
     ourselves under a watery spray?
    </p>
    <p>
     Although you might think taking a daily shower should be part of your cleaning
     <strong>
      ritual
     </strong>
     , there’s no hard and fast rule, although
     <strong>
      dermatologists
     </strong>
     agree that as a society, we shower too often. In fact, too much washing can
     <strong>
      deplete
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      vital oils
     </strong>
     in our skin. It can waste water as well. However, if you have a
     <strong>
      fitness regime
     </strong>
     that causes you to
     <strong>
      sweat
     </strong>
     , a more regular sprinkle of water is recommended to stop you
     <strong>
      ponging
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     How often you shower is, of course, a personal choice. There’s nothing better than a hot,
     <strong>
      soapy
     </strong>
     scrub under the shower, and this doesn’t just have to be to clean yourself. Some people enjoy a shower to help them relax, warm up or to soothe any
     <strong>
      aches and pains
     </strong>
     . It’s also a good opportunity to wash your hair at the same time. Again, though, experts say we shouldn’t shower too often because, like your skin, your hair contains essential oils that you don’t want to lose through excessive
     <strong>
      scrubbing
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     If the idea of a hot,
     <strong>
      steaming
     </strong>
     shower appeals, how about a
     <strong>
      freezing cold
     </strong>
     one instead? This might be a necessity if your boiler has broken, but some people choose this option because it has many
     <strong>
      health benefits
     </strong>
     , some experts claim. There is increasing evidence that
     <strong>
      braving
     </strong>
     an icy shower in the morning could
     <strong>
      keep
     </strong>
     illness
     <strong>
      at bay
     </strong>
     and may even help your brain stay sharp. A BBC podcast called Just One Thing with Michael Mosley, found the shock of being
     <strong>
      doused
     </strong>
     with cold water could have a positive impact on your body and brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of a cold shower might not make you jump out of bed in the morning, but whatever the temperature, a splash of water will wake you up and make you feel and smell great!
