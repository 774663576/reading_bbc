     由于温室效应，地球正在升温。当化石燃料燃烧时，释放出的二氧化碳进入大气层，像毯子一样将地球裹起来，这意味着热辐射无法发散，使地球表面温度升高。这个现象是地球上出现越来越多极端天气事件的原因之一。为减缓这种状况的加剧，人们可以在家里使用更节能的电器、尝试以蔬菜为主的饮食结构。本期节目介绍什么是温室效应。

     Our planet is
     <strong>
      heating up
     </strong>
     due to something called the
     <strong>
      greenhouse effect
     </strong>
     . This is one of the reasons why Earth is seeing more
     <strong>
      extreme weather
     </strong>
     events, such as
     <strong>
      heatwaves
     </strong>
     , forest fires and floods each year. But what exactly is the greenhouse effect, and what can we do to reduce it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's first think about a
     <strong>
      greenhouse
     </strong>
     – you may have one in your garden! It's a glass structure that protects plants against low
     <strong>
      temperatures
     </strong>
     by
     <strong>
      trapping
     </strong>
     heat inside. But, while this helps your plants grow, Earth is trapping heat in the same way, and it's causing
     <strong>
      global warming
     </strong>
     . When
     <strong>
      fossil fuels
     </strong>
     , such as coal, oil and gas, are burnt for power,
     <strong>
      carbon dioxide
     </strong>
     is released as a
     <strong>
      waste product
     </strong>
     . It enters the
     <strong>
      atmosphere
     </strong>
     and acts like a blanket around the planet, which means heat
     <strong>
      radiation
     </strong>
     can't escape and the temperature increases.
    </p>
    <p>
     The impact of
     <strong>
      gases
     </strong>
     on the Earth's
     <strong>
      climate
     </strong>
     was first investigated in the 1820s. Eunice Foote, a scientist and women's rights activist, tested the effects of
     <strong>
      sunlight
     </strong>
     on different gases that she put into glass cylinders. Her results showed that carbon dioxide traps heat more than other gases. The idea of the greenhouse effect was born.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what can we do to reduce the greenhouse effect? The UN recommends using more
     <strong>
      energy-efficient
     </strong>
     electrical appliances at home and switching to
     <strong>
      LED lightbulbs
     </strong>
     . Also, by washing your clothes at 30° instead of a higher temperature, around 40% less electricity is used over a year, according to the Energy Saving Trust. A change in diet is also something to consider. The charity A Well-Fed World, claim that
     <strong>
      plant-based
     </strong>
     foods, as opposed to meat and dairy, need less land and water to be produced. So, switching saves energy and lowers
     <strong>
      emissions
     </strong>
     , which contribute to climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
     We only have one planet, so let's try and take care of it as much as we can.
