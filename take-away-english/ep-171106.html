    <p>
     It’s a question that has puzzled scientists for a long time: why exactly do we yawn?
    </p>
    <p>
     In a recent breakthrough, scientists have discovered the part of the brain responsible for
     <strong>
      contagious
     </strong>
     yawning. It’s called the primary
     <strong>
      motor
     </strong>
     <strong>
      cortex
     </strong>
     , and controls movement in the body. When triggered it makes us yawn. But we can’t choose to yawn – it’s an
     <strong>
      involuntary
     </strong>
     imitation of other people. You know how it goes: your friend yawns, you yawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing which section of the brain is involved is only part of the answer. There is still a deeper question of ‘why’. And we don’t only yawn when others do, we sometimes yawn alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, let’s start with the
     <strong>
      physiological
     </strong>
     theories behind yawning. As far back as 400BC, Greek
     <strong>
      physician
     </strong>
     Hippocrates speculated that yawning released harmful gases from the body, like “steam escaping from a
     <strong>
      cauldron
     </strong>
     ”. His
     <strong>
      colourful
     </strong>
     theory is now, sadly,
     <strong>
      discounted
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A more recent idea suggests that we yawn in order to cool down the brain. Just like a busy computer processor, our brains can
     <strong>
      overheat
     </strong>
     . Psychologist Gordon Gallup from the University at Albany has argued that the act of yawning delivers a
     <strong>
      rush
     </strong>
     of oxygen to the brain, helping us think more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
     What about the connection between yawning and tiredness? We certainly yawn more when we’re feeling sleepy or
     <strong>
      sluggish
     </strong>
     , but why is this? Theories that it helps give the body extra energy are largely
     <strong>
      discredited
     </strong>
     , as we don’t yawn when we exercise, a time when we definitely need more
     <strong>
      get-up-and-go
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     Psychologist Catriona Morrison from the University of Leeds says yawning is an ancient
     <strong>
      reflex
     </strong>
     .  She told the BBC that it may have started in “the days of cavemen when someone had to be on watch all the time - yawning increases
     <strong>
      cerebral
     </strong>
     blood flow so can improve alertness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     What about our friends' contagious yawning? Some think it
     <strong>
      comes down to
     </strong>
     <strong>
      empathy
     </strong>
     . While all
     <strong>
      vertebrate
     </strong>
     mammals yawn, only humans and chimpanzees ‘catch’ yawns from others. Studies have shown we yawn more frequently when in the company of close relatives and friends. Could yawning actually help us
     <strong>
      cement
     </strong>
     our closest relationships?
    </p>
    <p>
     If it does, next time you yawn in company, don’t feel too embarrassed. You’re just showing off your
     <strong>
      people skills
     </strong>
     .

     1. Are we more likely to yawn in the company of our family or strangers?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      According to the article, we are more likely to yawn when with family and friends.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Why don’t we think yawning gives you a rush of energy?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The theory is no longer popular because if it were true, it would mean we would yawn at times when energy is badly needed, such as during exercise.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. True or false:
     <em>
      Humans and chimpanzees are the only mammals which yawn.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      False. The article says all vertebrate mammals yawn, but it’s only contagious in humans and chimpanzees.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4.Which word means ‘caused something to start’?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Triggered.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. True or false:
     <em>
      The author found Hippocrates’ idea appealing.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      True. The author seems to like Hippocrates’ idea, calling it “colourful” and saying it was “sad” it was no longer accepted.
     </strong>
