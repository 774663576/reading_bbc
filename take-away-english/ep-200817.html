     When you think of a cute, furry wild animal, you often picture a koala. These adorable-looking
     <strong>
      creatures
     </strong>
     appear docile and friendly, so it’s no wonder people are concerned about the future of the
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     after the devastating
     <strong>
      bushfires
     </strong>
     that destroyed parts of Australia earlier this year. Luckily, many survived, which gives us a chance to continue to learn more about these
     <strong>
      marsupials
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Australia’s native and unique wildlife such as
     <strong>
      kangaroos
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      platypus
     </strong>
     and koalas, are under constant threat from human activity and natural disasters. It’s thought at least a billion animals lost their lives as a result of this year’s bushfires. Recently, drones and thermal imaging technology have been used to
     <strong>
      track
     </strong>
     their movements to help them keep safe. Protecting these unique species is important because, as The Australian Koala Foundation estimates, there are now possibly as few as 43,000 koalas in the wild.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what is so special about koalas and what makes them so ‘cool’? Maybe we envy their ability to sleep for up to 22 hours day! Or could it be their
     <strong>
      laid-back
     </strong>
     appearance due to the fact that they are
     <strong>
      herbivores
     </strong>
     and mainly feed on juicy
     <strong>
      eucalyptus leaves
     </strong>
     , which take a lot of time and energy to
     <strong>
      digest
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     What is amazing is that because they often live in a dry and hot
     <strong>
      environment
     </strong>
     , they drink very little water. So, how do they survive? Well, scientists have discovered that these wild
     <strong>
      mammals
     </strong>
     lick running water off the smooth surface of a tree
     <strong>
      trunk
     </strong>
     when it is raining. This
     <strong>
      phenomenon
     </strong>
     is called "stemflow". Valentina Mella, the lead author of the research and an
     <strong>
      ethnologist
     </strong>
     from the University of Sydney, told the BBC: "I think the main message is that behavioural observations in the wild are very important to establish what is normal and what is unusual, and to truly understand what animals need. If we watch them carefully, they will tell us."
    </p>
    <p>
     So, despite the word ‘koala’ meaning 'no drink' or 'no water' in the
     <strong>
      Aboriginal
     </strong>
     language, it seems that even these sleepy creatures do need a drink sometimes. And if we’re to encourage them to
     <strong>
      flourish
     </strong>
     , we need to
     <strong>
      conserve
     </strong>
     their
     <strong>
      habitat
     </strong>
     .
