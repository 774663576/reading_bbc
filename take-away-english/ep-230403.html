     Throughout history, people have been attracted to puzzles, from Ancient Greek
     <strong>
      riddles
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      brain-teasing
     </strong>
     video games, people have tried to
     <strong>
      solve
     </strong>
     <strong>
      problems
     </strong>
     for fun. But what is it about these
     <strong>
      conundrums
     </strong>
     that makes us enjoy them?
    </p>
    <p>
     It could be that the desire to find a
     <strong>
      solution
     </strong>
     is wired into us. A study has shown that when people complete
     <strong>
      anagrams
     </strong>
     , it can stimulate the reward centre in the brain. One of the researchers behind the study, Yongtaek Oh, suggests that
     <strong>
      problem-solving
     </strong>
     ability provides an evolutionary advantage – it can help us survive! It's clear that this
     <strong>
      'aha' moment
     </strong>
     is very enjoyable, but it's not just
     <strong>
      completing
     </strong>
     a puzzle that people enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
     David Shariatmadari highlights that solving the best puzzles requires a combination of
     <strong>
      luck
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      skill
     </strong>
     . He points out that the
     <strong>
      element of chance
     </strong>
     makes it more open to a wide range of people, while the need for skill gives
     <strong>
      players
     </strong>
     a feeling that they are in control. This also helps to provide a balance between being something
     <strong>
      challenging
     </strong>
     and something
     <strong>
      achievable
     </strong>
     . Michael Vilensky, a psychologist at Ohio State University, tells us that puzzles offer us a situation that we can control and
     <strong>
      resolve
     </strong>
     , which can be satisfying when compared with other life challenges. Other experts, such as therapist Elizabeth Hinkel, argue that by requiring
     <strong>
      concentration
     </strong>
     , puzzles can provide
     <strong>
      mindful
     </strong>
     moments away from the stresses of everyday life. Puzzles can also have a social aspect, whether that's making it easy to share your
     <strong>
      scorecard
     </strong>
     on social media, or the fact that people are keen to help each other find
     <strong>
      clues
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      come up with
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      answer
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Puzzles and fun may even be dependent on each other, researchers at Drexel University have suggested. When looking at brain images, they found that some people preparing to do a puzzle showed activity associated with positive moods and that these people were better able to come up with solutions. They also found that subjects performed better on puzzles if they had seen a funny video beforehand.
