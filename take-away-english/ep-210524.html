     If you could travel back in time, which period of history would you visit? It’s a great question to ask your friends, and
     <strong>
      time travel
     </strong>
     is the subject of many
     <strong>
      science fiction films
     </strong>
     . Of course, sci-fi is familiar to most of us, but what is cli-fi? The simple answer is
     <strong>
      climate fiction
     </strong>
     – a
     <strong>
      genre
     </strong>
     which focuses on the subject of climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of the cli-fi examples we watch tend to be
     <strong>
      disaster
     </strong>
     <strong>
      films
     </strong>
     . It could be
     <strong>
      solar flares
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      ice ages
     </strong>
     <strong>
      devastating
     </strong>
     the planet, extreme flooding
     <strong>
      swamping
     </strong>
     the Earth with water, or super-storms that
     <strong>
      threaten
     </strong>
     life as we know it. While films and novels of this genre are often subject to the typical
     <strong>
      tropes
     </strong>
     of a
     <strong>
      hero
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      heroine
     </strong>
     battling to save the day, what sets it apart from most sci-fi films is that the
     <strong>
      plots
     </strong>
     will often draw on
     <strong>
      plausible
     </strong>
     outcomes in the present or near future.
    </p>
    <p>
     Climate change and the potential threats have long been established. Some believe that the issue of climate change has even led to more fans watching films to learn more about what’s happening to the world – seeing it as a form of
     <strong>
      edutainment
     </strong>
     . A study conducted by the Yale programme on Climate Change Communication tested the effects that two climate fiction novels can have on its readers and found “significant positive effects” in terms of their attitudes and beliefs towards the climate crisis – for example, understanding global warming will harm them and future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most climate films are not only
     <strong>
      blockbuster
     </strong>
     <strong>
      action
     </strong>
     <strong>
      films
     </strong>
     , but also prey on our fear of what some see as the
     <strong>
      impending
     </strong>
     doom of a climate
     <strong>
      catastrophe
     </strong>
     . This sounds bad, but according to a study conducted on 310 adults in the US, watching scary films can help us feel more prepared, resilient and less alone in situations such as the pandemic. So, it looks like cli-fi is here to stay – and there seem to be some benefits. Whether it’s there to educate, entertain or prepare you for a climate crisis, it might have a role to play.
