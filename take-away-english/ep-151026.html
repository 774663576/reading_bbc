     On 17 November 2007 a man was jailed for producing works of art. Why? Because the sculptures and
     <strong>
      artefacts
     </strong>
     Shaun Greenhalgh made were fakes: fakes that had
     <strong>
      conned
     </strong>
     museums and galleries out of over £500,000.
     <span>
      <span>

    <p>
     Shaun had left school with no qualifications, but
     <strong>
      tried his hand at
     </strong>
     a wide range of
     <strong>
      crafts
     </strong>
     – from
     <strong>
      watercolour painting
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      sculpture
     </strong>
     . The young Greenhalgh hoped to make it as an artist himself. His pieces were not admired, however, and he turned to
     <strong>
      forgery
     </strong>
     . He ended up creating a
     <strong>
      cottage industry
     </strong>
     in his garden shed, with the help of his family.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the son had a talent for art, his father, George, had
     <strong>
      the gift of the gab
     </strong>
     and approached potential buyers. He came up with detailed stories about how he found
     <strong>
      artworks
     </strong>
     which had been lost for generations. In 2003, they sold a 50cm statue called the 'Amarna Princess' to Bolton Museum. George claimed his own grandfather had bought it at an
     <strong>
      auction
     </strong>
     in 1892 at an
     <strong>
      aristocrat
     </strong>
     's home, and had papers which appeared to
     <strong>
      back up
     </strong>
     his story.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After talking to art experts, the museum paid more than £400,000 for the statue. The successful
     <strong>
      scam
     </strong>
     made the forgers grow bolder. But when they approached the British Museum with some more fake artefacts, an expert spotted mistakes and
     <strong>
      tipped off
     </strong>
     the police.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After 18 months of investigations, the police knocked at the family's door. They were surprised by the Greenhalgh's humble home. Where were the
     <strong>
      riches
     </strong>
     of successful criminals? The police concluded that Shaun was motivated by "a
     <strong>
      resentment
     </strong>
     of the art market" and by a desire to deceive art experts, rather than by money.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But how did he manage to fool so many experts? Irvin Finkel from the British Museum says the family produced things that "in a way we were looking for already". So when experts saw them they wanted to embrace these apparently long-lost treasures.
