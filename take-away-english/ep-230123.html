     For many time-poor, health-conscious people, the must-have kitchen
     <strong>
      gadget
     </strong>
     at the moment is an
     <strong>
      air fryer
     </strong>
     . From top
     <strong>
      chefs
     </strong>
     to humble students, many are
     <strong>
      singing the praises
     </strong>
     of the device that seems to be
     <strong>
      flying off the shelves
     </strong>
     at shops and online. One British department store reported sales increased by 400% in 2021. But are they really
     <strong>
      the best thing since sliced bread
     </strong>
     , or is the hype all just
     <strong>
      hot air
     </strong>
     ?!
    </p>
    <p>
     If you got one as a present, or bagged one in the sales, you'll already know the benefits. An air fryer avoids the need to
     <strong>
      deep-fry
     </strong>
     food in hot and often unhealthy oil. Instead, the food is cooked by having very hot air blown on it at high speed – it doesn't actually fry but
     <strong>
      bakes
     </strong>
     the food.
    </p>
    <p>
     The technology sounds simple, and Dr Jakub Radzikowski, Culinary Education Designer at Imperial College London, told the BBC: "You could compare it to drying your hair with a hairdryer." The combination of a powerful fan and a smaller compartment makes the air fryer more efficient and reduces the time needed to pre-heat it. In addition, because the food is cooked in a basket, excess
     <strong>
      fat
     </strong>
     will drip to the bottom, so you don't have to eat it. And it's good to know air fryers use less energy than a conventional
     <strong>
      oven
     </strong>
     because of the shorter cooking times needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people may question how
     <strong>
      versatile
     </strong>
     they are and whether they can be used for cooking whole
     <strong>
      meals
     </strong>
     . But experts have prepared
     <strong>
      crispy
     </strong>
     sweet potato fries, chips, and chicken and fish, quickly and with good
     <strong>
      flavoursome
     </strong>
     results –
     <strong>
      cooked to perfection
     </strong>
     . Dr Jakub Radzikowski's favourite is chicken legs or thighs, which he says after 20 minutes gives you something that's "perfectly
     <strong>
      juicy
     </strong>
     inside" with a skin that is so crispy it "shatters like glass".
    </p>
    <p>
     If this
     <strong>
      whets your appetite
     </strong>
     , remember that, because of the air fryer's size, there is a limit to the amount that can be cooked in them at one time. So your oven may still come in handy. But if you're on a budget or in a rush, it might be worth giving one a try and seeing what amazing meals you can
