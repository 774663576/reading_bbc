     小小蠕虫默默无闻、粘粘乎乎，还扭来扭去，但它们为什么被称为 “大英雄”？作为蠕虫的一种，蚯蚓可通过松动和混合土壤来助农耕者一臂之力；人们还发现蜡虫的唾液中含有可分解塑料的酶；血虫的口部为建筑师带来了设计灵感。原来小虫子真能帮大忙！

     Are
     <strong>
      worms
     </strong>
     the heroes we didn't know we needed? Silent,
     <strong>
      slimy
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      wriggling
     </strong>
     , you might think that worms are good for nothing except
     <strong>
      bait
     </strong>
     on the end of a fishing rod. However, there is more to the
     <strong>
      humble
     </strong>
     worm than meets the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     The British
     <strong>
      naturalist
     </strong>
     Charles Darwin said that no other animal has "played such an important part in the history of the world as these
     <strong>
      lowly
     </strong>
     organised
     <strong>
      creatures
     </strong>
     ". They have lived on Earth for 600 million years and have even survived five
     <strong>
      mass extinctions
     </strong>
     . So, what do worms do that is so great?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Earthworms
     </strong>
     literally move the earth, and this is why farmers love them. As they travel, they
     <strong>
      aerate
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      soil
     </strong>
     by
     <strong>
      loosening
     </strong>
     , mixing and
     <strong>
      oxygenating
     </strong>
     it, which increases the ground's capacity to hold and drain water. They are effectively a small but very efficient
     <strong>
      plough
     </strong>
     . But it's not just earthworms that deserve praise.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 2022, a group of scientists at the Margarita Salas Center for Biological Research isolated
     <strong>
      enzymes
     </strong>
     found in
     <strong>
      wax worm
     </strong>
     <strong>
      saliva
     </strong>
     which are
     <strong>
      plastic-eating
     </strong>
     . These can break down polyethylene, a very common plastic that normally degrades over many years. It's hoped that by producing these enzymes on an industry-level scale, we will have a more environmentally friendly way to reduce plastic pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
     And worms are even inspiring the building industry.
     <strong>
      Bloodworms
     </strong>
     are small sea creatures which
     <strong>
      burrow
     </strong>
     into the mud of the ocean floor. Scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara have been studying their
     <strong>
      jaws
     </strong>
     , which are made up of 10% copper proteins and are so strong that they last the worm's entire five-year lifespan. Because of this research, engineers may start using the jaws as inspiration for the design and manufacture of materials like concrete.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, next time you see a worm, show it a little respect. They really are changing the world!

     1. How long have worms existed on Earth?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      They have lived on Earth for 600 million years.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. How do earthworms help farmers?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      As they travel, they aerate the soil by loosening, mixing and oxygenating it, which increases the ground's capacity to hold and drain water.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. True or False?
     <em>
      Wax worms eat plastic.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      False. Enzymes found in wax worm saliva are plastic-eating.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Why might enzymes help to reduce plastic pollution?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Because the enzymes can break down polyethylene, a very common plastic that normally degrades over many years.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. What makes the jaws of the bloodworm so special?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      They are made up of 10% copper proteins and are so resistant that they last the worm's entire five-year lifespan.
