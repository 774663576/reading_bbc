     <strong>
      Vocabulary: Transport 词汇: 交通工具

    </p>
    <p>
     You know the feeling. You’re stuck in
     <strong>
      bumper-to-bumper
     </strong>
     traffic. It’s going to be hours before you get home. As we know all too well,
     <strong>
      congestion
     </strong>
     is one of the downsides of modern city living. Don’t you wish you could just
     <strong>
      take to the skies
     </strong>
     and soar above it all in a helicopter?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, wish no more. Right now,
     <strong>
      the race is on
     </strong>
     to release the first commercially
     <strong>
      viable
     </strong>
     sky taxi. No longer will personal air travel be the
     <strong>
      preserve
     </strong>
     of the super wealthy, say optimistic tech entrepreneurs. There’s just one
     <strong>
      catch
     </strong>
     : how do you feel about having no pilot?
    </p>
    <p>
     For brave passengers, the city of Dubai plans to roll out rides on their pilotless
     <strong>
      drone
     </strong>
     taxi project by the end of this year. You can
     <strong>
      buckle up
     </strong>
     and share the ride with one other passenger in their 18-rotor
     <strong>
      craft
     </strong>
     , developed by German start-up Volocopter, with a top speed of 100km/h and a flight time of around 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have more friends, French
     <strong>
      aviation
     </strong>
     company Airbus are working on a drone which can carry four to six customers. Or if you prefer your own company, Chinese firm Ehang are pioneering a single-seater drone, which stays
     <strong>
      airborne
     </strong>
     for 23 minutes.
     <strong>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Ride-hailing
     </strong>
     company Uber also want
     <strong>
      a piece of the action
     </strong>
     . They say drones like this are the “future of
     <strong>
      on-demand
     </strong>
     urban air transportation”. They recently poached NASA chief technologist Mark Moore to help them develop a drone taxi. And he claims it won’t
     <strong>
      cost the earth
     </strong>
     . Moore told the BBC that with three or four passengers sharing, it would be “very similar to what an UberX [car] costs today”.
    </p>
    <p>
     So far so good. But naturally, a number of questions remain. On the technical side, there’s the problem of batteries. A 23-minute flight could get you across town, but how and where does the battery recharge?
    </p>
    <p>
     And regulations are a challenge too. US authorities require aircraft to carry at least 20 minutes of spare fuel. If you only have 23 or even 30 in total, that leaves very little
     <strong>
      leeway
     </strong>
     . Control of access to
     <strong>
      flight paths
     </strong>
     will also need to be worked out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if these issues are tackled successfully, there’s still the
     <strong>
      biggie
     </strong>
     : safety. Will passengers really be willing to put their lives in the hands of a flying robot? Winning the trust of the regulators and the public may take time. But when they do, well,
     <strong>
      the sky’s the limit
     </strong>
     .

    <p>
     1. Why are batteries an issue?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Batteries only last a short time before needing to be recharged. US regulators also demand aircraft carry at least 20 minutes of spare fuel, which limits the flight time even further.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. What does the author believe is the most significant challenge for drone taxis to be successful?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The author believes that the biggest problem is convincing the public and regulators that drone taxis are safe.
