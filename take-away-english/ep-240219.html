     Are you feeling
     <strong>
      peckish
     </strong>
     ? Maybe it's a while until your next
     <strong>
      meal
     </strong>
     , so perhaps now you're thinking about reaching for a brightly coloured
     <strong>
      packet
     </strong>
     with something
     <strong>
      delicious
     </strong>
     inside. Maybe it's time for a snack. You're not alone, we all do it – but just how much work goes into developing and making the snacks that we all know and love?
    </p>
    <p>
     First, companies have to work out what people
     <strong>
      have an appetite for
     </strong>
     . Traditionally, they might just have asked people about their snack habits. In today's digital age, apps can ask customers to swipe right on the
     <strong>
      flavours
     </strong>
     they fancy. Companies can search the internet for every restaurant
     <strong>
      menu
     </strong>
     in a specific market, looking out for the latest
     <strong>
      taste
     </strong>
     trends and
     <strong>
      in-demand
     </strong>
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Snack trends also change over time. When British supermarkets were encouraged to remove unhealthy snacks from the shelves next to where people queue up, companies were quick to provide healthier
     <strong>
      treats
     </strong>
     . They can also reflect different histories of migration. One British snack company found that flavours common in South Asian
     <strong>
      cuisine
     </strong>
     sold well in the UK, but less so in the US, where there is less of a tradition of Indian food. And demand for more sustainability has led some entrepreneurs to experiment with using insects as an alternative source of
     <strong>
      protein
     </strong>
     for snacks. Other brands market themselves as offering a fairer price to the producers of the
     <strong>
      raw ingredients
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, what might seem like the perfect idea might not actually be that practical. Ingredients that work well in a restaurant, might not work on a
     <strong>
      biscuit
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      crisp
     </strong>
     . Snacks that contain a lot of
     <strong>
      fresh
     </strong>
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     may have too short a
     <strong>
      shelf life
     </strong>
     to be a viable product. Some designs might need expensive
     <strong>
      packaging
     </strong>
     to protect them, which stops them being profitable.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many factors that influence our snacks. Those that are successful reflect our tastes and concerns but can be limited by the manufacturing process.
