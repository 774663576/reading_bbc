     音乐人的创作灵感从何而来？鲍勃·迪伦说《鲁滨逊漂流记》等小说给他提供了写歌词的灵感。音乐剧作曲家斯蒂芬·桑德海姆认为研究歌词的抑扬顿挫对创作旋律很有帮助。泰勒·斯威夫特表示她的歌词中有很多反映真实生活的字句。看来不同的音乐人有不同的创作方法，这中间没有什么铁律。本期 “随身英语” 讨论歌曲创作的艺术。

     <strong>
      Singer-songwriters
     </strong>
     write songs, but how do they do it? Where do musicians get their inspiration from? What comes first – the music or the
     <strong>
      lyrics
     </strong>
     ? It turns out that everyone has their own way of writing which works for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bob Dylan is a musician with a unique musical style. It has been described as
     <strong>
      folk rock
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      gospel
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      country
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      jazz.
     </strong>
     He told the BBC that he gets a lot of his writing inspiration from novels like Don Quixote and Robinson Crusoe. He said 'They give you a way of looking at life and understanding of human nature and a standard to measure things by. I took that all with me when I started
     <strong>
      composing
     </strong>
     lyrics'. It seems to have worked for him. He has had a career spanning six decades and has won many songwriting awards.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what comes first, the music or the lyrics? Stephen Sondheim, a musical theatre
     <strong>
      composer
     </strong>
     who died in 2021, said in an interview with The New Yorker that, when it comes to songwriting, the
     <strong>
      stress
     </strong>
     in a
     <strong>
      phrase
     </strong>
     is very important for him. 'You can start writing a lyric, and then the
     <strong>
      inflection
     </strong>
     of the lyric suggests a
     <strong>
      tune
     </strong>
     .' Therefore, in his way of writing, the music and lyrics come at roughly the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 2022, Taylor Swift won a Songwriter-Artist of the Decade award. In her speech, she said lyrics are her favourite part of songwriting. She describes the majority of her songs as having a 'modern
     <strong>
      storyline
     </strong>
     or references, with a poetic
     <strong>
      twist
     </strong>
     ' and commonly uses real life experiences and conversations as influence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Aside from lyrics, an important part of many songs is the
     <strong>
      instrumental
     </strong>
     <strong>
      backing
     </strong>
     . This is often created with
     <strong>
      chords
     </strong>
     , where at least three
     <strong>
      notes
     </strong>
     are played at the same time, often on a piano or guitar.
     <strong>
      Chord progression
     </strong>
     is where different chords are played one after the other, and therefore can act as the base for
     <strong>
      vocals
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you're feeling musical,
     <strong>
      lay down
     </strong>
     some chords, get inspired and give it a go yourself!
