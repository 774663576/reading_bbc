     Imagine this scene: it's
     <strong>
      blowing a gale
     </strong>
     outside, you're
     <strong>
      snuggled up
     </strong>
     on the sofa under a warm
     <strong>
      duvet
     </strong>
     , chatting and reminiscing with your closest friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     That content,
     <strong>
      snug
     </strong>
     feeling has a name in Danish – 'hygge'. And, as Denmark recently won the title of 'happiest country in the world', the rest of the world is becoming more and more interested in finding ways to embrace this concept.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Hygge' - originally from a Norwegian word meaning '
     <strong>
      wellbeing
     </strong>
     ' - doesn't have an exact equivalent in English. It's often translated as cosiness, or as blogger Anna West told the BBC, ''cosiness of the soul." But, as translator ToveMaren Stakkestad explains: "Hygge was never meant to be translated. It was meant to be felt."
    </p>
    <p>
     Essentially, Hygge involves creating a warm, cosy atmosphere and enjoying it with your loved ones. Danish winters are long and dark and so achieving 'hygge' is particularly relevant during this season. A typical 'hygge' activity during winter could be, enjoying delicious
     <strong>
      homemade food
     </strong>
     and light-hearted conversation with friends – preferably in the
     <strong>
      warm glow
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of candlelight;
     </strong>
     or maybe sipping a glass of
     <strong>
      mulled wine
     </strong>
     in the hot tub after a day spent skiing.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, Hygge isn't only confined to the
     <strong>
      bleak
     </strong>
     winter months – it can also describe that warm,
     <strong>
      fuzzy feeling
     </strong>
     you get after a walk through a forest with friends on summer's day or a family barbecue in the park.
    </p>
    <p>
     The concept of 'hygge' is currently taking the world by storm with more and more people becoming obsessed with achieving a state of wellbeing.  Articles, books and
     <strong>
      stocking fillers,
     </strong>
     full of tips on how to achieve hygge, are hitting the market. Although, some believe this has become a marketing and advertising ploy, the benefits of staying happy cannot be underestimated. So, as the winter nights
     <strong>
      draw in
     </strong>
     , instead of
     <strong>
      hibernating
     </strong>
     , get into your favourite
     <strong>
      onesie
     </strong>
     , bake some cookies and
     <strong>
      curl up
     </strong>
     by
     <strong>
      a roaring fire
     </strong>
     with a good book. And if you can do this with friends and family, even better - hygge is meant to be shared.
