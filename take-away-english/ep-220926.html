     你也许听过 “年龄取决于你的想法” 这句话，实际上，这句话或许有些道理。研究表明，我们对待衰老的态度会对我们能活多久以及晚年的健康状况产生影响。本文讨论积极的态度是否可以延缓衰老。

     When do you think ‘
     <strong>
      middle age
     </strong>
     ’ starts? What about ‘old age’?
     <strong>
      Unsurprisingly
     </strong>
     , the answer to these questions will depend on your culture, as well as how old you are when someone asks you. What is perhaps more surprising is that the answer to these questions could
     <strong>
      have an impact on
     </strong>
     how quickly your body begins to
     <strong>
      age
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     In 2003, the researchers Hannah Kuper and Sir Michael Marmot
     <strong>
      carried out
     </strong>
     a
     <strong>
      wide-ranging
     </strong>
     study in which
     <strong>
      participants
     </strong>
     were asked the question: when does old age start? They then
     <strong>
      followed up
     </strong>
     with the participants six to nine years later and found that those who had thought old age began earlier were more likely to be in
     <strong>
      poor
     </strong>
     <strong>
      physical health
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But
     <strong>
      how could
     </strong>
     someone’s answer to a question about age
     <strong>
      possibly
     </strong>
     have an impact on their health? It might be that the question
     <strong>
      prompts
     </strong>
     people to think about their physical health,
     <strong>
      underlying
     </strong>
     health issues or
     <strong>
      poor lifestyle
     </strong>
     , which might then make them feel that old age is coming sooner. People who say that old age
     <strong>
      sets in
     </strong>
     earlier, may also be more
     <strong>
      fatalistic
     </strong>
     and less likely to visit a doctor or to
     <strong>
      adopt
     </strong>
     healthier routines. It’s even possible that the stress of having negative thoughts about ageing,
     <strong>
      contributes
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     more health problems.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, this is what happens when we think negatively about ageing, but what happens when we think positively? People who think old age starts later, may be more
     <strong>
      conscious
     </strong>
     about their health and fitness and therefore
     <strong>
      take steps
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     <strong>
      stay
     </strong>
     <strong>
      in
     </strong>
     better
     <strong>
      shape
     </strong>
     . They may see their
     <strong>
      twilight years
     </strong>
     as an opportunity to learn new things and make new plans. If they believe they are younger, they therefore behave in younger ways, creating a
     <strong>
      virtuous circle
     </strong>
     . Whatever the reason, according to data from the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Retirement, people who think positively about ageing live longer on average.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, none of this research means that a positive attitude can magically stop the
     <strong>
      ageing
     </strong>
     <strong>
      process
     </strong>
     – our bodies get older with each passing year, after all. But it seems that if we try to be healthier and if we believe that there are still things we can do in old age, we might live longer and enjoy ourselves more too.

     1. Can your attitude towards ageing affect the ageing process?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Yes. Thinking negatively about ageing can lead to poor physical health, whereas people who think positively about ageing live longer on average.

     2. True or False?
     <em>

      False. Kuper and Marmot followed up with the participants six to nine years after asking them the question: when does old age start?

    <p>
     3. Do we know exactly how or why someone’s attitude can affect the ageing process?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      No, we don’t. There are many possible reasons why thinking negatively about ageing can have negative results and thinking positively about ageing can have positive results.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. True or False?
     <em>
      Believing you are younger makes you act like you are younger.

      True. If someone believes they are younger, they behave in younger ways, creating a virtuous circle.

      No. A positive attitude can’t stop the ageing process, but – according to the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Ageing and Retirement – people who think positively about ageing live longer on average.
