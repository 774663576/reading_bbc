      词汇: Drink 喝酒
     </strong>

     <span>
      In Britain, it's
      <strong>
       bottoms up
      </strong>
      from the week before Christmas till the last firework explodes in the sky announcing the new year. The last Friday before Christmas - popularly known as 'Mad Friday' - is one of the busiest periods for the country's
      <strong>
       pubs
      </strong>
      and clubs.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      But it's not just the bars that get busy. Ambulances and
      <strong>
       A&amp;E departments
      </strong>
      around Britain get packed out too. Head injuries, cuts, falls… it's easy to end up hurting yourself or others when
      <strong>
       inhibitions
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       composure
      </strong>
      disappear and your head is spinning due to
      <strong>
       alcohol
      </strong>
      .
      <strong>
       Revellers
      </strong>
      have been warned by the health authorities about the dangers of excessive drinking but
      <strong>
       indulgence
      </strong>
      seems to be part of the festivities for some.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The charity Alcohol Concern is running a campaign of
      <strong>
       abstinence
      </strong>
      by encouraging people to have a dry January.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Jackie Ballard, the charity's Chief Executive, believes the initiative has been successful in recent years. She says: "More than two-thirds of people even six months later are drinking at reduced levels having had a month off
      <strong>
       booze
      </strong>
      . But also a study has shown the impact it has on people's health reducing their
      <strong>
       blood pressure
      </strong>
      and blood sugar levels."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The study by the University of Sussex followed up nearly 900 participants in Alcohol Concern's Dry January campaign and found out that 72% of them had kept harmful drinking sessions down and 4% were still not drinking. Fears that a booze-free month would cause people to
      <strong>
       binge
      </strong>
      drink the next month didn't materialise.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      <strong>
       Moderation
      </strong>
     </strong>
     seems to be the key to everything. The official recommendation for women is not to regularly drink more than more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol a day. That's no more than a 175ml glass of 13%
     <strong>
      ABV
     </strong>
     wine. The limit for men is 3 to 4 units of alcohol - no more than a
     <strong>
      pint
     </strong>
     of 5.2% ABV lager, beer or cider.
