     你有过对不同文化的习俗感到困惑的经历吗？在英国，有些异乎寻常的习俗可能会让来自其它国家的人感到疑惑和惊讶。比如，为什么在英国车辆靠左行驶？为什么英国的水龙头是 “冰火两重天” — 一边出热水，一边出凉水？一旦你了解了前因后果，就会发现，这些看似奇怪的现象并非全无道理，本集《随身英语》介绍它们背后的历史起源。

      Vocabulary: quirks and confusion 词汇: 离奇和困惑

     To an outsider, any culture can seem
     <strong>
      quirky
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      confusing
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      peculiar
     </strong>
     or just downright
     <strong>
      bizarre
     </strong>
     . And the UK's got a thing or two that
     <strong>
      raises a few eyebrows
     </strong>
     . Brits are quite capable of
     <strong>
      befuddling
     </strong>
     visitors with their
     <strong>
      idiosyncrasies
     </strong>
     . However, understand the why and things might be less
     <strong>
      perplexing
     </strong>
     . Here are the reasons for three of Britain's more
     <strong>
      puzzling
     </strong>
     practices.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a world where 61% of nations drive on the right, the
     <strong>
      unorthodox
     </strong>
     Brits drive on the left. Why? "Most people think it goes back to Medieval, maybe even Roman times," explains Stephen Laing, curator of the British Motor Museum. This
     <strong>
      unusual
     </strong>
     behaviour
     <strong>
      makes sense
     </strong>
     when you remember that right-handed people wear a sword on their left hip. Travelling on the left allowed you to keep your weapon arm toward your opponent, who would be on your right. This practice persisted until the 18th Century when a law was passed requiring all traffic crossing London Bridge to keep to the left.
    </p>
    <p>
     Visitors to the UK that have just washed their hands in an old-fashioned sink might be wondering why one tap is solely for hot water, the other exclusively cold. Either can make washing very uncomfortable. So, why this
     <strong>
      oddity
     </strong>
     ? "It relates to a time when hot and cold water were kept separate to prevent contamination," Kevin Wellman, chief executive officer of the Chartered Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering says. Drinkable cold water came from a mains supply, but hot water came from attic tanks and was not considered suitable for consumption. So they were kept apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Millions of people drink tea worldwide, but the
     <strong>
      eccentric
     </strong>
     Brits put milk in theirs. Why? This
     <strong>
      mystifying
     </strong>
     practice relates to the quality of china cup used in the 18th Century when tea was first imported. For the majority of Brits, "the cups available couldn’t withstand the heat of the boiling water and would shatter, so milk was added first," Simon Hill, Tea Buyer at Bettys &amp; Taylors of Harrogate tells the Sun newspaper. This cooled the cup enough to withstand the water. And this practical tweak soon became a national habit.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      There's a method to the madness
     </strong>
     , they say. As you can see, these quirky Brits have perfectly
     <strong>
      coherent
     </strong>
     reasons for left-hand driving, two-tap sinks and tea with milk. But until you
     <strong>
      comprehend
     </strong>
     them, they can seem
     <strong>
      unfathomable
     </strong>
     . Even if they still seem strange, at least now you're
     <strong>
      in the know
     </strong>
     .
