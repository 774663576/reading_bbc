     你的桌面是乱七八糟还是整洁干净？英国一项心理学研究显示，桌上物品的摆放方式可以揭示人格特征。环境心理学家构思出了五种不同的“书桌人格类型”。那么你属于哪种呢？是内向极简型、还是惬意杂乱型？《随身英语》分析这五种书桌所展现的性格特征。

     Are you the kind of person whose desk is alwa­­ys
     <strong>
      spick and span
     </strong>
     ? Or is it a bit of a mess? How you organise your working space can say a lot about you. In fact, environmental psychologist Lily Bernheimer developed five distinct "desk personality types" in a study commissioned by UK co-working firm Headspace Group. Which of them best reflects you?
    </p>
    <p>
     First up: are you "the clutterer"?
     <strong>
      Clutter
     </strong>
     means mess – and Bernheimer says a clutterer's desk is likely to be colourful, chaotic and covered in trinkets. These people are usually more
     <strong>
      extroverted
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      welcoming
     </strong>
     , and love being at the "crossroads" of the office. The
     <strong>
      hitch
     </strong>
     is that they're often too busy to tidy up after themselves!
    </p>
    <p>
     Or perhaps you're "the
     <strong>
      minimalist
     </strong>
     "? A
     <strong>
      polar opposite
     </strong>
     to the clutterer, the minimalist has nothing unneccessary on his or her desk. These workers are often highly
     <strong>
      conscientious
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      disciplined
     </strong>
     , if a little cautious. But Bernheimer says this does not necessarily mean they're
     <strong>
      introverts
     </strong>
     – they just love structure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Type three is "the expander". Personal space is very important to them, and it
     <strong>
      creeps
     </strong>
     ever outwards, even if this is not a consciously
     <strong>
      aggressive
     </strong>
     act. Berheimer says: "They may try to claim more and more
     <strong>
      territory
     </strong>
     for themselves by moving their coffee cup and their sandwich out further and further."
    </p>
    <p>
     "The personaliser" is our fourth type, and it’s quite self-explanatory. These people customise their space with photos, mementos and personal objects. "A simple, stylish or unusual workspace tells people that you’re high in the
     <strong>
      trait
     </strong>
     called '
     <strong>
      openness
     </strong>
     ', which means you're likely to be high in creativity, intellectuality and openness to new experience," says Bernheimer.
    </p>
    <p>
     And finally, there's "the surveyor". These people feel
     <strong>
      insecure
     </strong>
     in the middle of the office, and seek out the quieter corners. From an evolutionary perspective, looking for well-protected spots from which to
     <strong>
      keep an eye out
     </strong>
     for potential threats makes sense. Surveyors are often introverted, but also highly
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     and creative, if given the space and support they need.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whichever type you are, making personal statements through presentation is deep in our nature, says Sam Gosling, professor of psychology at the University of Texas: "One of the reasons physical spaces, including one's office desks, can be so
     <strong>
      revealing
     </strong>
     is that they're essentially the
     <strong>
      crystallisation
     </strong>
     of a lot of behaviour over time."
