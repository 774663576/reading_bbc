     一锅炖了60天的炖菜，你会吃吗？那一盆煲了49年、仍在不断加入新原料的老汤呢？这类经过持续炖制、永不离火、锅不见底的菜品被人们称作 “永久炖菜”。有些人担心它不卫生，而有一些人则认为菜品经炖制后使病原体无法存活，因此可以放心食用。本文介绍 “永久炖菜” 的前世今生。

     What's the oldest meal you've eaten? Maybe you've had
     <strong>
      leftovers
     </strong>
     from a few days ago. They probably still tasted good. But what if it wasn't a few days ago, what if you ate a 60-day old
     <strong>
      stew
     </strong>
     ? Or a 49-year-old
     <strong>
      beef noodle soup
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Perpetual stew is a
     <strong>
      dish
     </strong>
     that is never
     <strong>
      taken off the heat
     </strong>
     ; it's never finished. As
     <strong>
      portions
     </strong>
     are served, new
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     are put in the
     <strong>
      pot
     </strong>
     to replace them. One day's stew becomes the basis of the following days' meals. There have been some famous examples. This year, Annie Rauwerda's 60-day stew became a social media sensation. One Bangkok restaurant claims to have been cooking its beef noodle soup since the 1970s. It has been suggested that perpetual stew was a tradition in Medieval Europe when the effort required to start a fire meant that they were left to burn all day, and a pot of stew was always
     <strong>
      simmering
     </strong>
     away on top of it. One New York Times article tells us about a stew in Normandy that was kept cooking for 300 years.
    </p>
    <p>
     This tradition may date back to the Middle Ages, but thankfully, our understanding of
     <strong>
      food hygiene
     </strong>
     has developed since then. In a world where food is often thrown away once it reaches its
     <strong>
      use-by date
     </strong>
     , many people have asked how safe perpetual stew can actually be. Experts are divided, some maintain that as long as the stew is kept
     <strong>
      bubbling away
     </strong>
     at a temperature too high for pathogens to survive, it should be safe. Others suggest that meat can become dangerous if it's left in the stew for too long. Concerns have also been raised that some vegetables, such as potatoes, or those containing
     <strong>
      nitrates
     </strong>
     , could become more
     <strong>
      toxic
     </strong>
     the more they are
     <strong>
      reheated
     </strong>
     .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Advocates of
     <strong>
      slow cooking
     </strong>
     believe that the best food takes time, but even they may be surprised by a months or years-old perpetual stew.
