     你有没有想过为什么看到别人打哈欠后自己也会打哈欠？据研究人员称，如果你认为自己和一个正在打哈欠的人之间有相似之处，那么你是否也会打哈欠将受到影响。本文讨论为什么人们会打哈欠，为什么打哈欠会传染。

     <strong>
      Yawning
     </strong>
     is something we all do – maybe because we’re
     <strong>
      bored
     </strong>
     carrying out tedious tasks or because we’re
     <strong>
      tired
     </strong>
     . Sometimes, just seeing other people yawn can
     <strong>
      set you off
     </strong>
     . But is this
     <strong>
      biological function
     </strong>
     really
     <strong>
      contagious
     </strong>
     , and why do we do it in the first place?
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of us think we open our mouths when we yawn to take in more
     <strong>
      oxygen
     </strong>
     , but in fact it appears there is no clear biological reason. According to BBC Bitesize, new research suggests it might be because yawning cools the brain down and prevents it from
     <strong>
      overheating
     </strong>
     , much like the fan in your laptop. This might be why we’re more likely to feel
     <strong>
      drowsy
     </strong>
     and yawn in warm temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is clear is that we yawn more when we’re
     <strong>
      exhausted
     </strong>
     and ready for a
     <strong>
      nap
     </strong>
     , and we can’t control when we do it – once we start, there’s no stopping us! But it’s also true that yawning is a very contagious
     <strong>
      behaviour
     </strong>
     . John Drury, a researcher from Sussex University, told the BBC that “it’s meant to be
     <strong>
      automatic
     </strong>
     ; it’s something that you can’t stop. Dogs yawn when their owners yawn, animals yawn to each other. It happens whether you want to or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     His research into this
     <strong>
      cognitive
     </strong>
     behaviour found that there is a connection with our social group and how close we are to the people in it. If we
     <strong>
      identify with
     </strong>
     the person who
     <strong>
      exhibits
     </strong>
     the behaviour, we are likely to copy it too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other research by the University of Nottingham in 2017 found similar results. They asked volunteers to watch other people yawn. They found their ability to
     <strong>
      resist
     </strong>
     yawning when others around them yawned was limited. And the
     <strong>
      urge
     </strong>
     to yawn was increased when people were told they couldn’t. They also found, when using
     <strong>
      electrical stimulation
     </strong>
     , that they were able to increase people’s desire to yawn. These findings, they say, could be useful because it could help treat other conditions like Tourette’s, which involve the same area of the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     What is certain is that a yawn can
     <strong>
      creep up on us
     </strong>
     at any time even when we think we’re not tired – but, I hope, not when you’re reading this article!
