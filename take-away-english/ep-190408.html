    <p>
     It's human nature to want to play. From board games to sports, games have been an integral part of human culture since time immemorial. Since their invention in the mid-20th century, video games have been among the most popular
     <strong>
      pastimes
     </strong>
     . In fact, in 2018 UK
     <strong>
      gamers
     </strong>
     spent on average over seven hours a week playing, according to market research conducted by global network provider Limelight. But how much is too much? When does
     <strong>
      entertainment
     </strong>
     become an
     <strong>
      addiction
     </strong>
     ? Are we
     <strong>
      hooked
     </strong>
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     video games?
    </p>
    <p>
     'The
     <strong>
      urge
     </strong>
     to play never goes away,' said Sean – not his real name - on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. His
     <strong>
      fixation
     </strong>
     with gaming once involved playing for 48 hours
     <strong>
      straight
     </strong>
     . It
     <strong>
      consumed
     </strong>
     him to the point he would ignore his family and children and ended up losing them along with his job and home. Since then he has checked into
     <strong>
      rehab
     </strong>
     , and despite
     <strong>
      falling off the wagon
     </strong>
     once or twice, he has been
     <strong>
      on track
     </strong>
     for the last 14 months.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Sean' is not alone. The UK Addiction Treatment group have noticed an increase in the number of people seeking
     <strong>
      treatment
     </strong>
     for gaming addiction from four in 2014 to 22 in 2018, they told the BBC. And in 2018 the World Health Organization classified gaming addiction as a disorder. In the UK, an enquiry into technology addiction held by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee included testimony from self-professed gaming addicts. One, Matus Mikus, said "games by their very nature are
     <strong>
      addictive
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the association for UK Interactive Entertainment informed the committee that there was a 'lack of evidence' around the addiction. They stated that gaming could be a 'force for good, encouraging, among other things,
     <strong>
      critical thinking
     </strong>
     skills'. Indeed, in a 2018 BBC article, registrar in anaesthetic and intensive care at Sheffield Teaching Hospital, Rajin Chowdhury seems to agree. Gaming, he says, made him more
     <strong>
      dextrous
     </strong>
     , improved
     <strong>
      hand-eye coordination
     </strong>
     and aided procedures that were performed remotely through looking at a screen, especially where the
     <strong>
      surgery
     </strong>
     <strong>
      controls
     </strong>
     were not
     <strong>
      intuitive
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Are video games addictive? It's unclear. Like anything,
     <strong>
      moderation
     </strong>
     is key. The games themselves may not be the problem, but letting them negatively impact our lives certainly is. With that in mind, play well, have fun and don't forget to take regular breaks.
