     </strong>

    <p>
     Something I enjoy doing most in my leisure time is going to the cinema – the movies – to watch a great film. It's two hours of
     <strong>
      relaxation
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      escapism
     </strong>
     from real life. But when I
     <strong>
      kick-back
     </strong>
     in my seat to enjoy the film and tuck into my box of popcorn, I'm often
     <strong>
      irritated
     </strong>
     by seeing someone next to me texting on their mobile phone or worse still, talking to someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's no surprise that a proposal by a US cinema chain to let people use their phones during some film screenings was met with such
     <strong>
      outrage
     </strong>
     , that the company had to withdraw the idea.  People said it was 'the worst idea ever'! Surely, going to watch the latest blockbuster is just that – watching not
     <strong>
      dual-screening
     </strong>
     . And if you're out with a friend it seems very
     <strong>
      antisocial
     </strong>
     or just rude. I certainly get distracted by the click-click on someone's mobile keyboard as they text and the glow of the bright small phone screen – why aren't they concentrating on the big screen?!
    </p>
    <p>
     But with the availability of streaming films at home and cheap DVDs, cinemas are
     <strong>
      struggling
     </strong>
     to keep their customers. Some places now offer comfortable seats with complimentary snacks and drinks so maybe trying to attract a younger audience by allowing the use of mobile phones is the way forward? A survey in 2012 found that a majority of 18-to-34-year-olds believed using social media while watching a movie would add to their experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sociologist, Julie Albright, says "
     <strong>
      Millennials
     </strong>
     have become very good at multi-tasking so they think nothing of looking at their phone while doing other sorts of things including
     <strong>
      consuming
     </strong>
     films and television and other media."
    </p>
    <p>
     However, not every young person wants to multi-task at the movies. Many of us still get annoyed by the theatre staff who appear not to do anything about it. Of course, we could ask the
     <strong>
      offenders
     </strong>
     to turn their phones off but as Adam Aron, head of AMC Entertainment, said in Variety magazine, "when you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear 'please cut off your left arm above the elbow'." Clearly this is not what I would like to see but if you are
     <strong>
      tempted
     </strong>
     to use your mobile phone in the cinema that I'm at, please don't sit next to me! What do you think is the right thing to do?
