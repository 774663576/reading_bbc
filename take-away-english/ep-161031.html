     童年期遗忘的谜团过去一个世纪以来一直困惑着科学家们。为什么在人类的幼儿期，一个充满体验和学习新事物的阶段，却被许多难以理解的事物而笼罩？本期《随身英语》探索可能导致我们遗忘幼儿时期经历的原因。

      词汇:记忆

    <p>
     What is your earliest memory? For me, I have a
     <strong>
      hazy
     </strong>
     <strong>
      recollection
     </strong>
     of standing in a leafy garden surrounded by
     <strong>
      silver birch
     </strong>
     trees when I was four years old.
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm around average: some people remember events as far back as two years old, while for others, things seem
     <strong>
      patchy
     </strong>
     until seven or eight.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what is consistent is that no one can remember their own birth or very early
     <strong>
      infancy
     </strong>
     . And even after the first memory, most of us only have a
     <strong>
      sporadic
     </strong>
     collection of
     <strong>
      fleeting
     </strong>
     , flickering mental images until much later in childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
     The phenomenon is known as 'childhood
     <strong>
      amnesia
     </strong>
     ', a term
     <strong>
      coined
     </strong>
     by the father of
     <strong>
      psychoanalysis
     </strong>
     , Sigmund Freud. So, what's going on here?
    </p>
    <p>
     Babies are, writes Zaria Gorvett for BBC Future, "
     <strong>
      sponges
     </strong>
     for new information, forming 700 new
     <strong>
      neural
     </strong>
     connections every second and
     <strong>
      wielding
     </strong>
     language-learning skills to make the most
     <strong>
      accomplished polyglot green with envy
     </strong>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     And it's precisely this rapid mental development that causes the problem, according to a study by the University of Toronto in 2014. It found that the high rate of infant brain cell production could increase
     <strong>
      forgetfulness
     </strong>
     , because new cells
     <strong>
      interfere
     </strong>
     with existing mental circuits.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another possible explanation is that the part of the brain that stores memories, the hippocampus, is not fully formed until around 18 months. Identity is also important: tests show infants don't recognise themselves in the mirror until they are around two years old.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, there's the question of how accurate our early memories are at all. "People can pick up suggestions and begin to
     <strong>
      visualise
     </strong>
     them - they become like memories," psychologist Elizabeth Loftus told the BBC. Are our
     <strong>
      cherished
     </strong>
     first memories really just family stories?

    </p>
    <p>
     1. Why can't people remember the first years of their lives?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Three reasons are given. Firstly, in the first years of our lives our brains are growing so fast that new brain cells interfere with existing mental circuits. Secondly, the hippocampus is not fully formed until 18 months old. Thirdly, babies don't develop a sense of identity until around two years old.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. What does it mean to be a 'sponge for new information'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Being a 'sponge' means you acquire a lot of new information very quickly, the same way a sponge fills with water.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. True or false?
     <em>
      Babies are accomplished polyglots.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. Although babies learn languages very fast, an 'accomplished polyglot' is someone who has learned several languages to a very high level.
     </strong>
     <strong>
      <br/>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Which word means 'very green and covered in plants'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Leafy.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Why might our earliest memories actually be false?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      According to Elizabeth Loftus, people pick up suggestions and visualise them - this makes these mental images seem like memories.
     </strong>
    </p>
