     <strong>
      Time flies
     </strong>
     , or so they say. No matter where you are, humans are constantly measuring and checking time. Some of us are good at it – planning and doing things way
     <strong>
      ahead of time
     </strong>
     - while others are always trying to
     <strong>
      beat the clock
     </strong>
     and do things
     <strong>
      at the eleventh hour
     </strong>
     . And that’s only if you’re
     <strong>
      on time
     </strong>
     . What about if you are
     <strong>
      behind time
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Tardiness
     </strong>
     can be serious. If you were one minute late for work, would you resign? It may sound extreme to many of us, but that is exactly what occurred in the UK upper chamber of parliament, the House of Lords, in January 2018. International development minister Lord Bates arrived one minute late, and, as a result, was unable to answer a
     <strong>
      scheduled
     </strong>
     question. Instead of trying to
     <strong>
      make up for lost time
     </strong>
     , as many might do, he resigned on the spot. He apologised for his discourtesy and stated that he was ashamed. His resignation, though, was not accepted by the UK prime minister.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, how
     <strong>
      late
     </strong>
     is too late? Many cultures take
     <strong>
      punctuality
     </strong>
     very seriously, whereas others seem to accept
     <strong>
      lagging
     </strong>
     behind as just the normal way of things. Members of the BBC from various different cultures were asked about the concept of
     <strong>
      timekeeping
     </strong>
     in their native countries and responded with a raft of answers.
    </p>
    <p>
     BBC employees from Latin America, Rwanda and Sri Lanka said that there are more flexible attitudes to timekeeping in their cultures. In Latin America, things may happen five minutes, 20 minutes, an hour or even two after they were planned. Whereas, in Sri Lanka, lateness is a part of the daily routine. This is because of poor infrastructure and heavy traffic conditions. In Rwanda, those who attend to
     <strong>
      deadlines
     </strong>
     with
     <strong>
      rigid
     </strong>
     <strong>
      timekeeping
     </strong>
     are said to be ‘like a typical European’. This is in a place where it is not unusual to arrive at 11am for a meeting which started at nine.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other hand, German and Japanese employees mentioned a stricter adherence to time. In Japan, it is common to make an effort to arrive
     <strong>
      with time to spare
     </strong>
     for an appointment. Those who arrived
     <strong>
      at the stroke of
     </strong>
     nine to a meeting starting at nine a.m. would be considered late. In Germany, however, if a dinner party were to begin at eight, a person who had arrived five minutes
     <strong>
      prior
     </strong>
     , may walk around the block to ensure that they arrive at eight
     <strong>
      on the dot
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems that the answer is subjective, and what is considered acceptable is based on culture. That said, if you don’t mind waiting, it might be best to attend your appointments
     <strong>
      in good time
     </strong>
     . And if the worst comes to the worst, remember the old English proverb.
     <strong>
      Better late than never
     </strong>
     .
