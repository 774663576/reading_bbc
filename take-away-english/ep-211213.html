     It’s the middle of winter, and the prospect of warm sunny days is a long way off. For some of us, it’s the most
     <strong>
      depressing
     </strong>
     time of year, where daylight is limited and the weather is often miserable – this is when
     <strong>
      the winter blues
     </strong>
     set in. So what can be done to
     <strong>
      lift our spirits
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     The shorter days and longer nights can make us feel
     <strong>
      down
     </strong>
     , and that can cause us to eat more and exercise less. Some fear
     <strong>
      loneliness
     </strong>
     and isolation during the long dark months. Those people who suffer this seasonal
     <strong>
      mood swing
     </strong>
     more seriously are described as having
     <strong>
      seasonal affective disorder
     </strong>
     – or SAD for short. It’s a type of
     <strong>
      depression
     </strong>
     with a seasonal pattern caused by a lack of light and is thought to affect the part of the brain that rules sleep, appetite, mood and activity levels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jenny Scott-Thompson is one person who was
     <strong>
      diagnosed
     </strong>
     with SAD. She told the BBC: “I struggled with periods of
     <strong>
      exhaustion
     </strong>
     and misery that seemed out of proportion to what was going on in my life.” She was prescribed
     <strong>
      light therapy
     </strong>
     , which involved sitting in front of a light box. As well as going outside during daylight hours, this is believed to help anyone who is affected by the winter gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although having more light is an obvious cure,
     <strong>
      antidepressants
     </strong>
     can help those with more severe depression by artificially elevating the amount of
     <strong>
      serotonin
     </strong>
     in the brain. But this isn’t suitable for everyone, and many of us can try to just alter our
     <strong>
      mindset
     </strong>
     . Clinical psychologist Laura Keyes says, “it can be helpful to think about how to
     <strong>
      adapt
     </strong>
     your eating and exercise patterns to the change of season, just as this happens in nature with plants and animals adapting.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It might sound
     <strong>
      easier said than done
     </strong>
     , but accepting winter and thinking positively may
     <strong>
      energise
     </strong>
     us. Writing for the BBC Social website, Esther De La Ford asks “What if we explored what this phase of winter has to offer us, instead of
     <strong>
      grieving
     </strong>
     those things that it is taking away?” She suggests we use this time for rest, reflection, slowing down, stillness and renewal. Maybe this might stop us longing for summer?
