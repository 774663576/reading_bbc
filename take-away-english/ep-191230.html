      Vocabulary: tattoos 词汇：文身

     Do you have any tattoos? I don't. I've never been brave enough to go
     <strong>
      under the needle
     </strong>
     . But if you do have one, you are not alone. According to a report by Experian, the number of
     <strong>
      tattoo parlours
     </strong>
     in Britain increased by 173% between 2004 and 2014. Tattoos have always been controversial – personally and culturally. Some people love them and some hate them. So, are they good or bad?
    </p>
    <p>
     These days, one in five people in the UK has some
     <strong>
      ink
     </strong>
     – whether it's a
     <strong>
      commemorative
     </strong>
     date, a
     <strong>
      sleeve
     </strong>
     or a full
     <strong>
      body suit
     </strong>
     . What's responsible for this rise in popularity? "You see a lot of celebrities getting tattooed," says Lee Clements of the British Tattoo Artist Association speaking on BBC radio. As a result, people want to copy them or it becomes a fashion thing – certain tattoos become a trend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Employers have become more accepting of visible
     <strong>
      tats
     </strong>
     too. Last year, London's Metropolitan Police relaxed a ban on recruiting candidates with visible
     <strong>
      body art
     </strong>
     . And earlier this year, Air New Zealand said it would end a ban on body art to allow workers to express their
     <strong>
      individuality
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      cultural heritage
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     That said, not all employers would agree. Grace, 28, told the BBC that she had been offered jobs in sales, which were then withdrawn when employers saw her hand tattoo. "It feels like having a tattoo is not
     <strong>
      socially acceptable
     </strong>
     ," she says. "Having a tattoo does not amount to a protected characteristic," remarks Susan Harris, legal director at the GMB union, a UK trade union. This means a person can be dismissed for having one if it breaches the employer's
     <strong>
      dress code
     </strong>
     – except on religious grounds.
    </p>
    <p>
     And let's not forget the risk of
     <strong>
      infection
     </strong>
     . At present anyone in the UK can set up a parlour and offer
     <strong>
      procedures
     </strong>
     without proper training, a report from the Royal Society for Public Health says. They note that just under 20% of those tattooed experience negative side effects, including
     <strong>
      swelling
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      burning
     </strong>
     or a skin infection.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems that attitudes to tattoos are changing, but they aren't quite there yet. Should you be persuaded to have one – visit a reputable tattoo artist with a portfolio. Discuss your design with them and don't make a hasty decision! If you later regret it, your tattoo will need
     <strong>
      laser removal
     </strong>
     or a
     <strong>
      cover up
     </strong>
     . Better get a
     <strong>
      temporary tattoo
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      henna tattoo
     </strong>
     first and see if you're happy with it. Wear it for a few months and then decide.
