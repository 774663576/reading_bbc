     背包旅行是一种低预算且随性的旅行方式。以洛林和迈克为例：他们退休后，每人背着一个15公斤重的背包，沿英格兰海岸徒步行走了630英里。再举一例，奥斯曼·佐拉提背包行遍了24个非洲国家，然而他启程时身上只有80美元。背包旅行似乎适合任何人，并不受年龄和预算的限制。听节目，看看你有没有作 “背包客” 的潜质。

     Do you know anyone who has
     <strong>
      gone
     </strong>
     <strong>
      backpacking
     </strong>
     ? It's a type of travel that is
     <strong>
      low-cost
     </strong>
     and independent, often meaning no fixed plans regarding
     <strong>
      accommodation
     </strong>
     or destination. The word 'backpacking' comes from '
     <strong>
      backpack
     </strong>
     ', a type of bag that you carry on your back. Travellers typically fill a backpack with life
     <strong>
      essentials
     </strong>
     , like clothing, plus anything extra needed for
     <strong>
      adventure
     </strong>
     . The stereotypical view of a
     <strong>
      backpacker
     </strong>
     is someone in their 20s, keen to
     <strong>
      tick
     </strong>
     <strong>
      off
     </strong>
     items on their
     <strong>
      bucket list
     </strong>
     . But, forget this. You're about to find out that anyone can backpack.
    </p>
    <p>
     Last year, my best friend's parents
     <strong>
      retired
     </strong>
     at aged 65 and
     <strong>
      set off
     </strong>
     on a 630-mile
     <strong>
      trail
     </strong>
     along the southwest coast of England. Each carrying a 15kg backpack, Mike and Lorraine
     <strong>
      hiked
     </strong>
     along cliffs, explored golden sandy beaches and even cycled. For accommodation, they didn't
     <strong>
      pre-book
     </strong>
     but stayed in whatever they could find on the day, which varied from
     <strong>
      B&amp;Bs
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      camping
     </strong>
     in fields full of sheep. They did stop for the occasional well-deserved cup of tea – they were in England after all.

     Backpackers are also known for travelling with little money, but few begin with as little as Othmane Zolati from Morocco. In 2015, he
     <strong>
      embarked
     </strong>
     on an almost four-year
     <strong>
      journey
     </strong>
     , but he started out with just $80 (£64). He
     <strong>
      zigzagged
     </strong>
     across 24 countries on the African
     <strong>
      continent
     </strong>
     and filmed his experience, aiming to show the world the diversity and beauty of Africa, all on a
     <strong>
      shoestring budget
     </strong>
     . He told BBC What's New that he often had to work
     <strong>
      odd jobs
     </strong>
     and rely on the kindness of strangers to be able to afford to keep travelling. But it was worth it. South Africa was Othmane's final
     <strong>
      destination
     </strong>
     and, on reaching it, he said "It was one of the best moments in my life. It made me know that if you fight for something, you really stick to that goal… then you will reach it".

    <p>
     So, don't give up. If you want to travel, you can, no matter your age or budget!
