     科学家们发现，目前地球的自转速度比过去50年来的任何时候都要快。专家们认为，2021年将会是几十年来最短的一年。不过，我们是不是应该在这一年结束前争分夺秒，抓紧时间？本期节目讨论我们不需要为此惊慌的原因。

      词汇：time 时间

    <p>
     ‘
     <strong>
      Time waits for no man
     </strong>
     ’ – or so the saying goes. We can’t stop time and we can’t control it, although sometimes, in our minds, we think
     <strong>
      time flies
     </strong>
     – for example, when the weekend arrives, we feel it’s over
     <strong>
      in no time
     </strong>
     ! But if this year in particular feels like it’s passing more quickly than others have done, there could be a scientific explanation why.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, we know a year is usually 365 days long. Clever scientists
     <strong>
      calculated
     </strong>
     this a long time ago. They also worked out that every four years, we need an extra day to keep our calendar
     <strong>
      in sync
     </strong>
     – this is called a
     <strong>
      leap year
     </strong>
     . But 2021 isn’t one of those years, and yet it’s not behaving like a normal year. Scientists and astrophysicists have
     <strong>
      done the math
     </strong>
     and discovered the Earth is moving faster than it ever has in the last 50 years. This means that 2021 is going to be the shortest year in decades.
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, this is because the Earth is spinning faster on its axis, quicker than it has done in decades, and the days are therefore shorter. But they are only short by a tiny amount – around 0.05
     <strong>
      milliseconds
     </strong>
     – so don’t panic if you haven’t noticed! However, long-term these milliseconds
     <strong>
      add up
     </strong>
     . Astrophysicist Graham Jones and Konstantin Bikos from Time and Date told The Independent newspaper: “If the Earth’s rotation continues to quicken, we may at some point require a
     <strong>
      negative
     </strong>
     <strong>
      leap second
     </strong>
     . If this happens, our clocks would skip a second in order to
     <strong>
      keep up with
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      hurrying
     </strong>
     Earth.” Since 1972, 27 leap seconds have only been added to our time and none have been taken away.
    </p>
    <p>
     This really is only of concern for
     <strong>
      atomic clocks
     </strong>
     – the most
     <strong>
      accurate
     </strong>
     <strong>
      timekeeping
     </strong>
     devices in history. Studying the Earth’s rotation and then subtracting or adding a leap second to these clocks can ensure they remain
     <strong>
      aligned
     </strong>
     and keep us
     <strong>
      on time
     </strong>
     . But now, maybe we need to get a move on before this ‘shorter’ year is gone
     <strong>
      in a split second
     </strong>
     !
