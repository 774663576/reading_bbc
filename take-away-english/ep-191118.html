     Have you ever gone out without
     <strong>
      putting your face on
     </strong>
     ? Whether it's a dash of
     <strong>
      foundation
     </strong>
     or a full
     <strong>
      application
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      lipstick
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      blusher
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      mascara
     </strong>
     , many would consider make-up essential before being seen. According to a survey by Fragrance Direct, a leading UK beauty retailer, the average UK woman uses twelve
     <strong>
      beauty products
     </strong>
     in their
     <strong>
      beauty regime
     </strong>
     daily – that's approximately £500 spent annually. But behind the monetary cost lies another, and it's one that many consumers may not know about.
    </p>
    <p>
     70% of
     <strong>
      cosmetics
     </strong>
     are manufactured using
     <strong>
      palm oil
     </strong>
     – a substance which is controversial, and, according to many, environmentally damaging. Between 1990 and 2008, oil palm tree
     <strong>
      plantations
     </strong>
     were responsible for the
     <strong>
      deforestation
     </strong>
     of around 8% of the world's forests, according to the BBC. This leads to a loss of
     <strong>
      biodiversity
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      habitat
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      wildlife
     </strong>
     – particularly those already
     <strong>
      under threat
     </strong>
     , such as the orangutan. And demand for the
     <strong>
      crop
     </strong>
     is increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
     To further complicate things, we can't simply ban it or stop using it. It's the most widely used vegetable oil on the planet and responsible for an industry worth more than $40 billion. Stopping its production would ruin many people's livelihoods worldwide. Worse, alternative vegetable oils, such as rapeseed, coconut or sunflower, would require up to ten times as much land to produce the same amount. This would only exacerbate the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is hope, though, of
     <strong>
      sustainable
     </strong>
     palm oil based on a global standard set by the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – a group of growers, retailers, NGOs and manufacturers. To meet their standards, a company must not clear any primary forest, treat workers fairly, and create wildlife zones, among other things. However, many critics say that these rules are not strict enough. According to a report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, there is limited evidence of effective conservation as a result.
    </p>
    <p>
     That said, in 2016, 75% of the total palm oil imports to the UK were sustainable, according to the BBC. Many retailers and leading brands use it, but as a consumer, knowing which is which can be difficult. The RSPO has a logo, but it rarely gets printed on the
     <strong>
      cosmetic
     </strong>
     label. The best we can do for now is check the ingredients carefully and do some research.
