      How do you pay for your coffee? Is it with
      <strong>
       change
      </strong>
      ? I use my
      <strong>
       tap-and-go card
      </strong>
      . I don't even need to enter my
      <strong>
       PIN number
      </strong>
      or a
      <strong>
       signature
      </strong>
      to authorise payment. It's quicker and everybody in the queue is happy.

      <strong>
       Contactless payments
      </strong>
      are gaining popularity. Those concerned about security will be pleased to know that the amount of money you can spend in one go is limited – in the UK it's currently £30. But if the card is used a few times in a row, a PIN number will be needed. If a thief gets hold of your card and goes on a
      <strong>
       spending spree
      </strong>
      , your bank covers you against
      <strong>
       fraud
      </strong>
      . Whereas, if someone steals your
      <strong>
       banknotes
      </strong>
      , that's your bad luck!
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      For those who are always forgetting where they put their cards, there's a new solution:
      <strong>
       wearable tech
      </strong>
      : clothing and accessories that have integrated electronic technology. Kenneth Cukier, an economist and technology expert, says: "You can simply take any
      <strong>
       wireless
      </strong>
      card and the
      <strong>
       chip
      </strong>
      from it that your bank might issue you with, and you can put it in a coat. When you want to make a payment just wave your arm in front of the terminal and leave the coffee shop with your latte. This is intended for people who don't want to take their card out of their wallet, use their phone or their watch."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Good, isn't it? And new ways of spending money are not stopping there. The future is all about
      <strong>
       biometrics
      </strong>
      . Very convenient if you are at the beach or a festival – there's a new system in development which will make it possible to read the unique maps of
      <strong>
       veins
      </strong>
      under the surface of your finger, and use them to
      <strong>
       authenticate
      </strong>
      payments – or prove that it's you making the payments. You just need to remember which finger you registered with.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So spending money is becoming easier all the time. And the temptation to buy more stuff increases. But it's worth bearing in mind that earning the money in the first place will still require the same effort. Back to work then!

      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <strong>
       Because the payment is quick and they don't have to wait long for their turn.

      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <strong>
       Because there's a limit to how much can be spent at a time. And if the card is used several times in a row, a PIN number is required.
