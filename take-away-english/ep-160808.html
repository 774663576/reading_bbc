     Do you have
     <strong>
      a business brain
     </strong>
     ? Are you always looking for the next
     <strong>
      big idea
     </strong>
     ? Maybe, like me, you might feel setting up a new company is something you might do when you're older, when you have more experience. But that's not always the case.

    <p>
     While some of us may feel young adulthood is a time of tentatively finding our place in the world, sleeping late and partying hard, others are already on a path to great business success. Take the
     <strong>
      founder
     </strong>
     of Microsoft, Bill Gates, who started his company as a young university student at Harvard in the US. There are many other examples of young
     <strong>
      entrepreneurs
     </strong>
     who have become hugely successful, proving that there's no minimum age to becoming
     <strong>
      top dog
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But to be the next business
     <strong>
      executive
     </strong>
     requires effort. You need to
     <strong>
      acquire
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a keen mind
     </strong>
     and good business
     <strong>
      acumen
     </strong>
     and above all, you need enthusiasm. Starting a new business comes with an element of risk but if you are able to spot the next big idea, it's probably worth giving it a try. Jessica Rose owns a jewellery making business and admits that "when I first started I had no business training whatsoever… but I kind of woke up one day and thought I'd really love to be a jewellery designer." She went on to be a successful young entrepreneur.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being young and in business does have its
     <strong>
      drawbacks
     </strong>
     ; you may worry you have nothing
     <strong>
      to bring to the table
     </strong>
     and that the people who work for you tend to be older and wiser. That's what young British entrepreneur Suleman Sacranie found. He started his third business whilst studying chemistry at university. He says "now I've got two additional directors who have grey hair" but when they first started he says he "could tell they were thinking in the back of their heads, 'I've got a kid sitting in front of me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     You may think setting up a new start-up is
     <strong>
      easier said than done
     </strong>
     . As well as ideas, you need
     <strong>
      financial backing
     </strong>
     and expert guidance. But if you're studying hard at university and don't have the desire to go into business and make your fortune, keep on studying – an education is
     <strong>
      priceless
     </strong>
