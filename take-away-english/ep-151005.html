     The first year of school can be
     <strong>
      stressful
     </strong>
     – not for the kids, but for the parents!
    </p>
    <p>
     They want their little ones to do well at school and some
     <strong>
      pushy parents
     </strong>
     will already be thinking about how they can get their child to
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      top of the class.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     But some parents are
     <strong>
      concerned
     </strong>
     about the
     <strong>
      rules
     </strong>
     for when children should start school.
    </p>
    <p>
     The School
     <strong>
      Admissions
     </strong>
     Code for England says that children must join the
     <strong>
      reception
     </strong>
     class the September after their fourth birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
     But here is the problem: A four year old who is born in August could be in the same class as someone who was born in October of the previous year! Both of them were four years old in September.
    </p>
    <p>
     The older child will probably
     <strong>
      do better
     </strong>
     in class tests. He or she is almost a year older! This can affect the
     <strong>
      confidence
     </strong>
     of the younger child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now England's schools minister, Nick Gibbs says that the rules should be changed. In an
     <strong>
      open letter
     </strong>
     to councils, schools and parents he says, "Parents know their children best".
    </p>
    <p>
     And he said that some parents "feel
     <strong>
      forced
     </strong>
     to send their child to school before they are ready".
    </p>
    <p>
     He
     <strong>
      proposes
     </strong>
     that children that are born during the summer can join the class when they are four or wait until they are five.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr. David Whitebread, an
     <strong>
      educationalist
     </strong>
     from Cambridge University says that the UK has a summer-born effect because children start school so young.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In countries with these later starting ages, there is a very much
     <strong>
      reduced
     </strong>
     summer-born effect or none at all", he said.
