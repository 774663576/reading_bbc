     假设这样一种情况：如果明天起，人类突然全部消失不见，那么等到两千年后，当那时的考古学家来到你我的厨房考察，寻找当年保存的食物时，还有哪些能吃？人类有各种各样新奇的食物保存方法。比如，将食物冷冻干燥、用食盐腌渍、放入真空包装密封起来。本期 “随身英语” 节目介绍哪些食物保存法最有效，以及有什么方法可以让食物保存2000年后依然可以食用。

    <p>
     Imagine for a moment you've travelled 2,000 years into the future. Which human foods do you think would
     <strong>
      stand the test of time
     </strong>
     , and would any of it still be
     <strong>
      edible
     </strong>
     ? To find out, we first need to understand what makes food
     <strong>
      go off
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Food preservation
     </strong>
     's main opponent is
     <strong>
      microbial growth
     </strong>
     . An expert in food chemistry, Michael Sulu, says most foods
     <strong>
      spoil
     </strong>
     for that reason. When things like
     <strong>
      bacteria
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      mould
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      yeast
     </strong>
     grow on your food, it can become
     <strong>
      pathogenic
     </strong>
     , and food causing disease is best avoided! So, how can we limit their growth?
    </p>
    <p>
     Microbes love oxygen and water, so the key is to starve them of it. We can do this by drying,
     <strong>
      salting
     </strong>
     , chilling, or storing the food in
     <strong>
      airtight
     </strong>
     containers. According to Sulu, drying is the most effective because without water, microbes can't multiply. Freezing works in the short-term, but explorers who have found ancient frozen animals initially thought the meat looked edible, but once
     <strong>
      defrosted
     </strong>
     , it immediately became
     <strong>
      putrid
     </strong>
     , which doesn't sound at all
     <strong>
      palatable
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     But how can we make our favourite foods
     <strong>
      longer-lasting
     </strong>
     if we don't want to dry, salt or freeze them? That's where
     <strong>
      additives
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      preservatives
     </strong>
     come in. These chemicals help to improve the
     <strong>
      shelf life
     </strong>
     of our supermarket items, but it means the food becomes
     <strong>
      ultra-processed
     </strong>
     . High consumption of ultra-processed food is linked to problems like depression and obesity, according to a review of the research by Pagliai and colleagues in the British Journal of Nutrition.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what's going to be safe for us to eat in our hypothetical time travel scenario? "I would start off with anything that is
     <strong>
      vacuum-packed
     </strong>
     or dried as well," says Sulu. If you can't find any of that, you could go to the Global Seed Vault in Svalbard, Norway, where there are almost one million samples of seeds from all over the world. They're in vaults designed to last forever, buried beneath the Arctic
     <strong>
      permafrost
     </strong>
     , so either eat the seeds, or start repopulating the plant world!
