     虽然我们大多数人不会对日常生活中的一些声音异常敏感，比如咀嚼声或呼吸声。但对于恐音症患者来说，这些简单的声音就足以让他们怒发冲天。本文介绍什么是 “misophonia（恐音症）”。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      词汇：misophonia 恐音症
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     There are some sounds most of us acknowledge are
     <strong>
      irritating
     </strong>
     – the
     <strong>
      crunching
     </strong>
     of crisps, the
     <strong>
      humming
     </strong>
     of the air conditioning or a
     <strong>
      screaming
     </strong>
     baby. These
     <strong>
      noises
     </strong>
     , for many people, act as a mere inconvenience that can distract us from the task at hand. However, there are some amongst us who have a much more severe response to these noises. The question we ask today is: has a noise ever made you feel so angry that you could explode with
     <strong>
      rage
     </strong>
     ? If the answer is yes, you may be suffering from misophonia.
    </p>
    <p>
     The word ‘misophonia’ literally means ‘a
     <strong>
      hatred
     </strong>
     of sound’ and is sometimes called
     <strong>
      Selective Sound Sensitivity Syndrome
     </strong>
     . There are some experts who doubt the existence of the condition. However, for those who claim to suffer from it, the experience can be
     <strong>
      traumatic
     </strong>
     . Certain sounds
     <strong>
      trigger
     </strong>
     intense emotional or psychological responses that may seem over the top compared with a non-sufferer’s complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of a loved one chewing their food could trigger a sufferer’s
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     levels, or cause them to
     <strong>
      panic
     </strong>
     . It may even activate their
     <strong>
      fight-or-flight
     </strong>
     reflexes, making them want to flee. In extreme cases, that feeling of panic may result in intense bouts of
     <strong>
      fury
     </strong>
     and end up with sufferers going
     <strong>
      berserk
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Sadly, there’s no known cure. Tinnitus retraining therapy, which helps people tolerate noises, may aid sufferers, while cognitive behavioural therapy and counselling could also help people manage the condition. According to James Cartreine, a clinical psychiatrist, the condition can lead to isolation. Sufferers use coping strategies that include avoiding places with lots of noises, like restaurants, or moving away when they feel like
     <strong>
      lashing out
     </strong>
     at someone due to their breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the next time you see someone fly into a rage because of a sound that is
     <strong>
      driving them crazy
     </strong>
     , it may be due to a difficult condition they are trying to manage, and not just because they
     <strong>
      loathe
     </strong>
     a certain sound.
