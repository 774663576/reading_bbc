     There are only a few truly pleasant smells to wake up to in the morning. It might be the
     <strong>
      aroma
     </strong>
     of freshly baked bread, or the scent of your partner's freshly brushed teeth – but for me, it's the smell of freshly
     <strong>
      brewed
     </strong>
     coffee. Just a sniff of it makes me jump out of bed and rush to the kitchen for a gulp of the hot black liquid. But then things quickly go downhill.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're a coffee
     <strong>
      connoisseur
     </strong>
     , you'll understand that opening a new packet of coffee releases an amazing smell – fresh,
     <strong>
      roasted
     </strong>
     coffee beans. Delicious! And if you
     <strong>
      've
     </strong>
     <strong>
      got a nose for
     </strong>
     the stuff, you'll be able to identify the beans'
     <strong>
      origin
     </strong>
     – Colombia, Vietnam or maybe Brazil – the world's biggest coffee producer. Tim Hayward is a food writer and coffee shop owner; he told the BBC that the smell "is absolutely vital, it's the key thing. And when you walk into the coffee shop in the morning and that smell hits you, you're getting
     <strong>
      physiological responses
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     I know from experience when I walk into a cafe for my
     <strong>
      double espresso
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      flat white
     </strong>
     , my
     <strong>
      mouth
     </strong>
     begins to
     <strong>
      water
     </strong>
     in anticipation. Although it's really the
     <strong>
      caffeine hit
     </strong>
     I'm after, it's the smell that makes me feel good.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, this feeling sometimes turns to disappointment when I actually start drinking my hot
     <strong>
      beverage
     </strong>
     – the taste just doesn't match the smell. This is particularly the case when I order a coffee
     <strong>
      to go
     </strong>
     in a tall paper cup and
     <strong>
      sip
     </strong>
     the liquid through a hole in the lid. Yes, it's convenient, but is it really the right way to appreciate it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Tim Hayward describes this process as 'weird' and 'baffling'. He says, "You walk into the coffee shop, you get the smell, but when you actually take the drink out, you are drinking it from something that is designed to
     <strong>
      deliver
     </strong>
     the hot liquid directly past your tongue, but stop any smell coming up to your nose."
    </p>
    <p>
     As well as eliminating the smell, takeaway coffee cups create a lot of waste and a vast majority of them still don't get recycled. In 2011, it was estimated that 2.5 billion coffee cups were thrown away each year in the UK, and that figure is likely to be higher now. So maybe now is the time to really
     <strong>
      wake up and smell the coffee
     </strong>
     by drinking from a cup or
     <strong>
      mug
     </strong>
     in a cafe, chatting with friends and saving the planet!

    <p>
     1. Which country is the world's biggest coffee producer?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Brazil is the world's biggest coffee producer.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Name a style of coffee drink mentioned in the article.
     <br/>
     <strong>

     </strong>
     <strong>
      flat white.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Why might having a lid on a coffee cup spoil the taste?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      According to a coffee shop owner, having a lid on a coffee cup
     </strong>
     <strong>
      delivers the hot liquid directly past your tongue but stops any smell coming up to your nose, and that can affect the taste.
     </strong>

     </em>
     True or false?
     <em>
      Drinking coffee in a cafe means the cups don't get recycled.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      False. It is takeaway coffee cups that often don't get recycled. A cup or mug used in a cafe can be used again and again.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Which word used in the article means 'easier to use/not causing difficulties'?
     <strong>
      <br/>
      <strong>
