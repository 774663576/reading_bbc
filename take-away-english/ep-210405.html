     在过去，玩电子游戏赚钱似乎是一个黄粱美梦。如今，越来越多的人正在成为职业游戏玩家。本文围绕这个新兴职业展开讨论。

     From
     <strong>
      pixel
     </strong>
     representations of table tennis in the 1970s to modern day cinematic storytelling, video games have evolved a lot and become more
     <strong>
      immersive
     </strong>
     . But it’s not just the
     <strong>
      graphics
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      gameplay mechanics
     </strong>
     that have changed – it has also opened up a range of career options, including that of professional gamer.
    </p>
    <p>
     When gaming first started, those who loved video games and wanted to make a career out of them often ended up as
     <strong>
      developers
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      testers
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      coders
     </strong>
     . While there were
     <strong>
      competitions
     </strong>
     , sometimes held worldwide, in which
     <strong>
      amateur gamers
     </strong>
     could win money or prizes, it wasn’t really considered a career path until the late 2000s, when
     <strong>
      live
     </strong>
     <strong>
      streaming
     </strong>
     really took off and gamers became celebrities.
    </p>
    <p>
     With
     <strong>
      e-sports
     </strong>
     now an integral part of gaming, what does a professional gamer’s life look like? The key, according to many pro-gamers, is practice – the same with many sports. While choosing the best
     <strong>
      peripherals
     </strong>
     is important, such as the right
     <strong>
      controller
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      keyboard
     </strong>
     , most pro-gamers spend hours every day working out
     <strong>
      hacks
     </strong>
     to save time or improve their chances of winning. And it’s not just while playing games that they need to be active, but also
     <strong>
      in real life
     </strong>
     . Exercising and stretching is vital to avoid injuries to their backs and wrists and preventing
     <strong>
      eye fatigue
     </strong>
     from spending long hours staring at
     <strong>
      monitors
     </strong>
     by taking regular
     <strong>
      screen breaks
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But it’s not just the physical aspects that gamers need to be careful with. According to some experts, like Dr Phil Birch, while the physical demands of e-sports and traditional sports are very different, the psychological impacts can be similar: regulating emotions, dealing with pressure and big crowds, and overcoming injury are just some of the common factors.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while the life of a pro-gamer may sound fun with lots of
     <strong>
      button bashing
     </strong>
     , just remember that it takes a lot of discipline and hard work to do it full-time.
