     报告显示太空垃圾数量在不断增加。在过去的几十年里，卫星和火箭被发射到太空中，随之在太空中产生垃圾。本文介绍人们如何清理太空垃圾。

     Many of us ponder what lies in
     <strong>
      outer space
     </strong>
     . When we look up at the night sky, we see stars, the
     <strong>
      twinkle
     </strong>
     of a moving
     <strong>
      satellite
     </strong>
     and occasionally a distant planet. But one thing we don’t see is the millions of pieces of
     <strong>
      junk
     </strong>
     filling up space. It’s this
     <strong>
      debris
     </strong>
     that’s causing problems for the existing technology that’s up there and which we rely on.
    </p>
    <p>
     The amount of space junk is increasing. Over the last few decades, satellites and
     <strong>
      rockets
     </strong>
     have been
     <strong>
      launched
     </strong>
     into space,
     <strong>
      littering
     </strong>
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      cosmos
     </strong>
     as they go. It’s estimated there are now millions of discarded pieces of metal and other materials in
     <strong>
      orbit
     </strong>
     – everything from old rocket
     <strong>
      segments
     </strong>
     to accidentally dropped
     <strong>
      astronaut
     </strong>
     tools, and even flecks of paint. The fear is that if we don’t start taking this litter out of the sky soon, it will become a significant threat to active satellites. Nobu Okada, Chief Executive of Astroscale – a company working on ways to clean up space junk – says hitting “even a small paint fleck… has enough power to blow up other satellites.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Several ideas are being looked at to capturethe debris
     <strong>
      floating
     </strong>
     around in space. In 2018, the RemoveDebris
     <strong>
      spacecraft
     </strong>
     carried out various experiments, including testing a net that could
     <strong>
      snare
     </strong>
     a satellite and firing a harpoon at a target in orbit to try to catch it.
    </p>
    <p>
     This year the UK Space Agency is helping to fund new approaches to tracking satellites and debris in space. Jacob Geer from UKSA told the BBC: “
     <strong>
      Space surveillance and tracking
     </strong>
     is one of the key things we can do to keep safe those satellites we rely on now, and to make sure certain orbits don’t become inaccessible for future generations because there’s too much debris in them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s clear that a solution is needed so a
     <strong>
      celestial
     </strong>
     <strong>
      deep clean
     </strong>
     can take place. But looking to the future, like any litter problem, we need to look at ways of creating less – and that shouldn’t be the stuff of
     <strong>
      science fiction
     </strong>
     .

     1. Give an example of something listed in the article that is space junk.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Old rocket segments, accidentally dropped astronaut tools, even flecks of paint.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. What is happening to the amount of junk in space?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The amount of space junk is increasing.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Why might space junk be a problem for satellites currently operating in space?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      A satellite might collide with the junk and blow up.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. According to Jacob Geer, why might too much space junk affect future generations?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Too much space junk would make space/orbit inaccessible for future generations.

     5. True or false?
     <em>

     <strong>
      False. Ideas to collect junk in space are already being tried so it is not science fiction.
