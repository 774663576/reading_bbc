     很多人都喜欢温暖晴朗的天气，但科学研究表明，未来的夏天可能会变得太热而让人无法忍受。如果全球温室气体排放量继续上升，气候将会改变。在一些地方，炎热的夏天和温暖的冬天可能会让堆雪人和滑雪橇成为过去。

     As winter takes its
     <strong>
      icy grip
     </strong>
     , and we head outside into a cold and
     <strong>
      crisp
     </strong>
     morning, we might be dreaming of warmer and sunnier days that lie ahead. Although, for many, summer might give us the most
     <strong>
      clement
     </strong>
     weather, our changing climate might mean that our
     <strong>
      chilly
     </strong>
     winter season becomes a thing of the past. So maybe we should enjoy it while we can.
    </p>
    <p>
     Last year, the World Meteorological Organization found that the Earth continued to endure a period of significant
     <strong>
      heating
     </strong>
     , making it one of the three hottest years on record. The most notable
     <strong>
      warmth
     </strong>
     was in the Siberian Arctic, where
     <strong>
      temperatures
     </strong>
     were 5°C above average. The evidence shows that much of this
     <strong>
      climate warming
     </strong>
     is driven by human activity.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a shift in
     <strong>
      meteorological
     </strong>
     <strong>
      conditions
     </strong>
     , we’re likely to see more
     <strong>
      record-breaking
     </strong>
     <strong>
      temperatures
     </strong>
     , where, in certain places, summers will be
     <strong>
      scorching
     </strong>
     hot and winters
     <strong>
      mild
     </strong>
     . This means for some,
     <strong>
      snowy
     </strong>
     winters could become a thing of the past. In the UK, a series of projections, based on accelerating
     <strong>
      global emissions
     </strong>
     , found that the average coldest day would not drop below
     <strong>
      freezing point
     </strong>
     . Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist, told the BBC: “It could mean the end of
     <strong>
      sledging
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      snowmen
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      snowball fights
     </strong>
     … the overarching picture is warmer, wetter winters; hotter, drier summers.” She’s described this as ‘a wake-up call’.
    </p>
    <p>
     Reducing
     <strong>
      greenhouse gas emissions
     </strong>
     is the obvious way to slow the rate of change in our climate. Some nations are promising to do this, but already we’re experiencing less
     <strong>
      snowfall
     </strong>
     and fewer
     <strong>
      frosty
     </strong>
     mornings. And on a bigger scale,
     <strong>
      glaciers
     </strong>
     are
     <strong>
      melting
     </strong>
     . According to modelling by Aberystwyth University in the UK, up to 92% of glaciers in the Alps could be lost by the end of the century due to climate change. So, if you’re lucky enough to be looking out on a
     <strong>
      winter wonderland
     </strong>
     , get outside and make the most of it before it melts.
