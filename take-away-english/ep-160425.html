     How often do you check your phone? According to a study led by Nottingham Trent University in Britain, the average person looks at their
     <strong>
      device
     </strong>
     85 times a day,
     <strong>
      browsing
     </strong>
     the internet or using
     <strong>
      apps
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Updating their status
     </strong>
     on
     <strong>
      social media platforms
     </strong>
     also made people reach for their electronic companion frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even the study's participants thought that was a lot: this figure is twice as often as they thought they did. Our phones might be
     <strong>
      shaping
     </strong>
     our behaviour more than we realise, and changing the way we
     <strong>
      interact
     </strong>
     with people right next to us. Do you actually look at your
     <strong>
      surroundings
     </strong>
     more than at your phone? Is it rude to check your phone when someone is talking to you?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sherry Turkle interviewed hundreds of college students about this. She's a
     <strong>
      clinical psychologist
     </strong>
     and a professor of
     <strong>
      social studies
     </strong>
     at the Massachusetts Institute of
     <strong>
      Technology
     </strong>
     . They talked about something they called 'the rule of three'.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rule has to do with being
     <strong>
      considerate
     </strong>
     to others in spite of the
     <strong>
      allure
     </strong>
     of the little flat box. Turkle explains: "If you go to dinner with friends, you don't want to look down at your phone until you see that three people are looking up in the conversation. So there's a new
     <strong>
      etiquette
     </strong>
     where you don't look down unless three people are looking up in order to keep a little conversation alive."
    </p>
    <p>
     Actually, if you are clever enough you might use your phone as a tool to
     <strong>
      connect
     </strong>
     with people next to you. How about showing them pictures stored in its
     <strong>
      memory
     </strong>
     ? Sharing a bit of your life with them can bring you closer together. And you can also invite everyone to take a
     <strong>
      selfie
     </strong>
     with you.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the best thing to deal with mobile phone addiction is
     <strong>
      to go cold turkey
     </strong>
     and leave the machine behind occasionally or just switch it off and keep it firmly in your pocket for a while. Who knows... 'life' might be what happens when you are too busy staring at a small screen.
