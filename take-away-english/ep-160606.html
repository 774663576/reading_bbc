    <p>
     You might have heard of people who consider suing their former
     <strong>
      employer
     </strong>
     for having been
     <strong>
      bullied
     </strong>
     or made to
     <strong>
      work overtime
     </strong>
     without pay. But what about taking your employer to court for having given you work that is too boring?
    </p>
    <p>
     That's exactly what Frederic Desnard, a 44-year-old Frenchman did. He claimed that his bosses at a prestigious perfume company
     <strong>
      stripped him of
     </strong>
     meaningful tasks in his
     <strong>
      managerial
     </strong>
     job and gave him duties which were so
     <strong>
      dull
     </strong>
     they affected his health.
    </p>
    <p>
     Desnard told French news agency AFP: "I went into
     <strong>
      depression
     </strong>
     , I was ashamed to be paid to do nothing".  He went on
     <strong>
      sick leave
     </strong>
     for seven months and was
     <strong>
      fired
     </strong>
     in 2014. The former employee wanted €360,000 in
     <strong>
      compensation
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people might argue that being bored should almost be part of the
     <strong>
      job description
     </strong>
     . Lars Fredrik Svendsen, author of 'A Philosophy of Boredom' and Professor of Philosophy at the University of Bergen, says, "Most of the words for work in various languages tend to tell that it's a really unpleasant phenomenon. The French word
     <em>
      travail
     </em>
     goes back to the
     <em>
      trepalium
     </em>
     , it was a word for a torture instrument."
    </p>
    <p>
     So should employers really care if their
     <strong>
      staff
     </strong>
     are
     <strong>
      bored to death
     </strong>
     as long as they do their tasks? Svendsen thinks it is in their interest to have a
     <strong>
      stimulated
     </strong>
     <strong>
      workforce
     </strong>
     . The academic says, "Employees who care about what they do tend to do a better job than those who don't. It will probably be wise for employers to at least
     <strong>
      facilitate
     </strong>
     some
     <strong>
      perception
     </strong>
     of meaning at work. Let the workers feel that their work is meaningful to them."
    </p>
    <p>
     In any case, Desnard might have
     <strong>
      been better off
     </strong>
     finding some meaning in his dull work as his action brought him some
     <strong>
      notoriety
     </strong>
     and not much else. A court in France didn't see things the same way he did and ordered Desnard to pay his former employer €1,000 for
     <strong>
      defamation
     </strong>
     .
