     Do you like to
     <strong>
      bury your head

     </strong>
     a good book? Getting absorbed in a good story is a great way to relax. It improves your
     <strong>
      literacy
     </strong>
     , and, according to some experts, it’s good for your health as well. Studies show that it can increase our
     <strong>
      emotional intelligence
     </strong>
     as we understand a range of perspectives and
     <strong>
      motivations
     </strong>
     . But despite these benefits, does the way we consume a story make any difference?
    </p>
    <p>
     For the
     <strong>
      purist
     </strong>
     , the only way to
     <strong>
      digest
     </strong>
     a good story is with a
     <strong>
      paperback
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      hardback
     </strong>
     book. Being
     <strong>
      in print
     </strong>
     , it’s possible to feel and even smell the book. And of course it’s very portable. But the traditional book has had a rival in recent years from
     <strong>
      e-books
     </strong>
     , which are read on
     <strong>
      e-readers
     </strong>
     or tablets. An ‘electronic’ book enables you to store hundreds of virtual books in one place and allows you to download books directly.
    </p>
    <p>
     The e-book has become popular in schools, too, and according to one school in London, it’s encouraged more children to read. 11-year-old Summit told the BBC: “If you really want a book, you can just get it online. It’s so easy, and it’s made me read more. I probably read every day now.” For adults, e-books are certainly a lightweight way of accessing our favourite
     <strong>
      literature
     </strong>
     on the move.
    </p>
    <p>
     The recent lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic have certainly given us all time to read more, and in the UK at least, sales of physical books have risen strongly. Last year, some 202 million paperbacks and hardbacks were sold, and the
     <strong>
      publishing
     </strong>
     industry hopes this trend will continue now that people have got into the habit of reading more.
    </p>
    <p>
     But for those who can’t or don’t want to look at the
     <strong>
      text
     </strong>
     in a book, there are
     <strong>
      audiobooks
     </strong>
     to listen to. According to Clare Thorpe, writing for the BBC Culture website: “There are hugely ambitious productions using ensemble casts, specially created
     <strong>
      soundscapes
     </strong>
     and technological advances… some authors are even skipping print and writing exclusive audio content.” No matter what your reading preference, there’s no doubt we are
     <strong>
      spoilt for choice
     </strong>
     in how we access a good story.
