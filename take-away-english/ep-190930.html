     There are around 600,000
     <strong>
      vegans
     </strong>
     in the UK, according to The Vegan Society. That's just over 1% of the population – an amount expected to increase to 25% by 2025. And if there's one type of food that Brits love, it's
     <strong>
      fast
     </strong>
     <strong>
      food
     </strong>
     . True, it's not the most
     <strong>
      nutritious
     </strong>
     , but there's nothing quite like the crunch of
     <strong>
      crispy
     </strong>
     chips, or that first big bite into a
     <strong>
      juicy
     </strong>
     hamburger. People in the UK love
     <strong>
      junk
     </strong>
     <strong>
      food
     </strong>
     so much that there was a 34% increase in the number of fast food outlets from 2010 to 2018, according to the Office for National Statistics. It's no surprise, then, that vegan fast food is also on the rise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Vegan fast food has become big business. At Just Eat, an online food delivery company, vegan orders more than doubled in 2018, a spokesperson told the BBC. Greggs, a chain of high-street
     <strong>
      bakeries
     </strong>
     , named its vegan sausage roll the 'fastest-selling product in six years'. And big franchises such as McDonald's and KFC have announced
     <strong>
      meat-free
     </strong>
     chicken
     <strong>
      nuggets
     </strong>
     to come in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     What's driving this popularity? Katrina Fox, founder of Vegan Business Media, believes it's the result of social media and the breaking down of stereotypes. "Vegan food is no longer seen as a bit of lettuce and
     <strong>
      lentils
     </strong>
     – you can eat pretty much anything," she told the BBC.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's also claimed that there are health benefits. John Marulanda, owner of Mooshies - a vegan burger bar in London – wants to implement "a change to a healthy version of fast food." Something, he claims, that comes as a result of the inherent
     <strong>
      nutritional value
     </strong>
     of the
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     they use.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, is vegan fast food actually healthy? Azmina Govindji of the British Dietetic Association says "not to assume" that is the case. "It's fine if those products have got
     <strong>
      vitamin
     </strong>
     B12,
     <strong>
      iodine
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      calcium
     </strong>
     added to them… but they can still be
     <strong>
      fried
     </strong>
     , it can still have lots of
     <strong>
      creamy
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      fatty
     </strong>
     <strong>
      sauces
     </strong>
     and lots of salt."
    </p>
    <p>
     Given the current growth in orders, the trend for vegan fast food isn't likely to disappear any time soon. Health-wise, it may not be any more
     <strong>
      nourishing
     </strong>
     than regular fast food, but for many, the lack of animal suffering involved in the process is a big plus.
