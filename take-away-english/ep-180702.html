     自1994年以来，网上购物已经慢慢地侵蚀了“传统”的高街零售体验。现在，许多人更愿意在网上购物。但这是为什么呢？为什么时至今日，网上购物“门庭若市，熙来攘往”，而传统商店却无人问津？本集《随身英语》讨论不断增温的网上购物热潮。

     The first thing sold online was a CD. It sold in 1994 for $12.48. In 1995, Amazon launched its online bookshop, and later that year the online
     <strong>
      auction
     </strong>
     site that would become eBay sold its first item. Fast-forward to the modern day and online shopping is huge business. In contrast to the recent UK announcements that many high-profile retail
     <strong>
      chains
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      department stores
     </strong>
     need to close
     <strong>
      retail outlets
     </strong>
     to save money, online shopping is thriving. In fact, the UK Office for National Statistics reported that growth in online sales has continued "year-on-year" and stands at just under 20% in April 2018. But why?
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it's the convenience. Online shopping allows you to find what you need from the comfort of your own home. Then there's the variety. The
     <strong>
      discerning shopper
     </strong>
     is able to select from
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     wide
     <strong>
      range
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of products
     </strong>
     from all over the world – whereas physical shops suffer from a more
     <strong>
      limited choice
     </strong>
     . Better yet, with more sophisticated search parameters available,
     <strong>
      consumers
     </strong>
     are now better able to specify exactly what they want, and in some cases, even modify products to create
     <strong>
      bespoke
     </strong>
     items.
    </p>
    <p>
     Online companies are getting better at
     <strong>
      targeted advertising
     </strong>
     too. Our browsing history and
     <strong>
      prior purchases
     </strong>
     are run through algorithms, which generate advertisements that more closely link consumers to the products companies believe we would like to buy. And since these products are not physically
     <strong>
      on display
     </strong>
     in a shop, the company saves money on overheads like rent and electricity. This allows them offer their products at a more
     <strong>
      reasonable price
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Then there's the reassurance. These days, the majority of online retailers offer a safe, convenient
     <strong>
      returns policy
     </strong>
     , often at no
     <strong>
      shipping cost
     </strong>
     to the buyer – just print out the returns label, affix it to the packaging the item was sent in and receive a
     <strong>
      full refund
     </strong>
     . Not only that, but
     <strong>
      hassle-free
     </strong>
     <strong>
      complaints procedures
     </strong>
     and policies mean that if your item is damaged, incorrect or even unwanted, the company can be easily notified and action taken.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many people still enjoy the experience of buying in a real shop. The dialogue and
     <strong>
      customer service
     </strong>
     received from staff and special events that may be taking place in store can be big pulls. However, the "year-on-year" growth in the online retail sector, as observed by the UK Office for National Statistics, seems to imply that online retail is here to stay and will continue to be a major avenue to shopping for many customers.
