     人类真的是一个非常了不起的物种。我们通过进化已经基本适应了地球上的各种环境，并通过城市和乡村建立起了我们的文明。然而，在这个过程中，人类往往忽略了环境保护的重要性。为了应对气候变化和生物多样性的丧失，环保主义者们正在鼓励人们重新 “再野化” 我们的环境。本篇文章介绍什么是 “再野化” 以及它对环境的影响。

     Humankind has developed so much that
     <strong>
      urban sprawl
     </strong>
     and intensive
     <strong>
      agriculture
     </strong>
     now dominate our
     <strong>
      landscapes
     </strong>
     . Unfortunately, with that comes the threat of climate change and a loss of
     <strong>
      biodiversity
     </strong>
     . What if we could return these landscapes to places that
     <strong>
      teem with
     </strong>
     wildlife, with
     <strong>
      ecosystems
     </strong>
     <strong>
      thriving
     </strong>
     as they did centuries ago? Since the 1980s, the concept of rewilding has increased in popularity. But what exactly is it, and what are the keys to its success?
    </p>
    <p>
     Put simply, rewilding is a technique that returns landscapes to a
     <strong>
      wilder
     </strong>
     , more natural state. It often involves reintroducing plants or animals that used to live there, but now don't. Not-for-profit organisation Rewilding Europe says rewilding is "about letting nature take care of itself, enabling natural processes to
     <strong>
      shape
     </strong>
     land and sea, repair damaged ecosystems and restore
     <strong>
      degraded
     </strong>
     landscapes." So, unlike traditional
     <strong>
      conservation
     </strong>
     techniques, the aim is to reduce the need for human intervention once the programme has been set up.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a 2021 article called 'Guiding principles for rewilding', one suggestion is to introduce plants,
     <strong>
      prey
     </strong>
     animals, and
     <strong>
      fungi
     </strong>
     first, so that when the top
     <strong>
      predator
     </strong>
     is introduced, they have an appropriate
     <strong>
      habitat
     </strong>
     to support them. Other tips are more people focused. Even though rewilding is about reducing human presence in ecosystems, that doesn't mean we should be excluded from nature. The authors encourage compassion and learning from nature, rather than dominating it. They also say that, to avoid fear amongst
     <strong>
      rural
     </strong>
     communities that their farmland will be taken away, and that new predators will endanger their
     <strong>
      livestock
     </strong>
     , local people should be included so they have some control over the process and can directly benefit from it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alex Stevenson owns Jordan's Farm in Essex, England and is rewilding her fields, hoping to help the ecosystem thrive. She says, "I am rewilding to look after nature and to give life back to the
     <strong>
      soil
     </strong>
     " and adds, "you have to value nature because nature sustains us – we are part of it."
