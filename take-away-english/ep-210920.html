     We often try to save money for a variety of different reasons. It might be to
     <strong>
      save up
     </strong>
     for a new computer, put money aside into a
     <strong>
      rainy-day fund
     </strong>
     or put a deposit down for a
     <strong>
      mortgage
     </strong>
     on a house. Learning how to save is important, but a recent study showed that over half of all 22 – 29-year-olds living in the UK have no savings at all. Did they
     <strong>
      splurge
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      splash out
     </strong>
     on too many things, or are there other factors? And how can we become better savers?
    </p>
    <p>
     Many young people in the UK choose to live away from home, and the cost of renting can impact the amount we can
     <strong>
      tuck away
     </strong>
     in our
     <strong>
      savings
     </strong>
     . On top of that, according to a 2017 study, there is a huge
     <strong>
      pay gap
     </strong>
     in people in their twenties in the UK, with the top 10% earning 4.3 times per week as the lowest earners. Possibly the mentality of ‘saving more when I earn more’ has
     <strong>
      crept in
     </strong>
     . However, there were some positives, with the number of people
     <strong>
      in debt
     </strong>
     , not including student loans for university, having fallen from 49% 10 years ago to 37%.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, how can we improve our ability to save? First off, put a stop to those
     <strong>
      impulse
     </strong>
     buys. Ask yourself if you really need to buy something, even if it is
     <strong>
      on sale
     </strong>
     or looks like a
     <strong>
      bargain
     </strong>
     . One way you could control your spending
     <strong>
      urges
     </strong>
     is by using
     <strong>
      cash
     </strong>
     rather than card. Withdrawing cash before you go to a restaurant or shopping sets a fixed
     <strong>
      budget
     </strong>
     you must adhere to. Also, any
     <strong>
      change
     </strong>
     that comes from your
     <strong>
      transactions
     </strong>
     when you’re using cash can be put in jar and
     <strong>
      deposited
     </strong>
     into your account. Finally, setting up a
     <strong>
      standing order
     </strong>
     from your current account into your savings just after you receive your salary will
     <strong>
      ensure
     </strong>
     you have some money set aside for a time that you might need it. Just after getting paid is a good idea for this as it means you save before you’ve had the chance to spend.
    </p>
    <p>
     While there is some good news about debt for the twenty-somethings in the UK, the fact that over half have no savings is seen as a cause for concern. While it could be due to some economic
     <strong>
      disparity
     </strong>
     , there may be some other factors at play. However, there are some actions we can take to help us all become better savers.
