    <p>
     Will your job be done by a robot in the future? Bank of England economists predict that almost half of all UK jobs are under threat of
     <strong>
      automation
     </strong>
     . Those most
     <strong>
      at risk
     </strong>
     involve repetetive
     <strong>
      manual labour
     </strong>
     , such as factory
     <strong>
      positions
     </strong>
     . But could even the venerable
     <strong>
      profession
     </strong>
     of teaching soon have to compete against powerful electronic educators?
    </p>
    <p>
     At first glance, teaching might seem
     <strong>
      impervious
     </strong>
     to replacement by robots. Teachers use a range of
     <strong>
      soft skills
     </strong>
     that machines find hard to replicate. They
     <strong>
      gauge
     </strong>
     pupils' needs and
     <strong>
      tailor
     </strong>
     <strong>
      feedback
     </strong>
     accordingly. They adapt materials to make them more engaging and effective. And they provide pastoral care: looking out for students who
     <strong>
      lag behind
     </strong>
     or disrupt the class.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nonetheless, some believe the future of education will be technological. In an interview with Business Insider magazine, futurist Thomas Frey predicts that "by 2030 the largest company on the internet is going to be an education-based company that we haven't heard of yet."
    </p>
    <p>
     He thinks that 'bots' – online robot teachers – will make education so efficient that students will be able to
     <strong>
      compress
     </strong>
     an entire undergraduate degree into six months of learning. A bot learns what your "
     <strong>
      idiosyncrasies
     </strong>
     " "interests" and "reference points" are, "and it figures out how to teach you in a faster and faster way over time," according to Frey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether or not such incredible speeds will be reached, over the last decade there has been a huge increase in online learning platforms. Companies such as Udemy and Khan Academy produce courses that allow millions to learn at home for free, at their own pace. But there are limitations. Without the face-to-face stimulation of a classroom environment, the
     <strong>
      overwhelming majority
     </strong>
     of students fail to complete online courses. How to sustain motivation to learn is one more skill that online teachers will need to
     <strong>
      master
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, Frey admits there is some way to go: "Nobody has quite
     <strong>
      cracked the code
     </strong>
     for the future of education." What do teachers themselves think about this? Professor Donald Clark from Derby University in the UK thinks that we should
     <strong>
      embrace change
     </strong>
     , even though people will lose their jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "
     <strong>
      Artificial intelligence
     </strong>
     will destroy jobs - so why not use it for a social good such as learning?" he asked.

    </p>
    <p>
     2. How do bots teach?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Bots learn your idiosyncrasies, interests and reference points, and use this information to figure out how to teach you as fast as possible, according to Frey.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. What has been one of the main failures of online courses so far?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The majority of students fail to complete online courses because they struggle to maintain motivation without the face-to-face stimulation of a classroom environment.
     </strong>
    </p>

    <p>
     5. True or false: Frey believes we have already developed powerful robot teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
