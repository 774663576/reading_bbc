     全球人口正在经历老龄化，这重要吗？虽然人口老龄化意味着劳动人口比重下降，老年人更依赖政府救济，但这件事情也有积极的一面。有哪些办法可以减轻人口老龄化的影响？本期 “随身英语” 围绕这一现象展开讨论。

      词汇：age 年龄老化
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s one thing for certain – we’re all getting older. And while the older amongst us may be
     <strong>
      no spring chickens
     </strong>
     any more, growing old
     <strong>
      gracefully
     </strong>
     is no bad thing. And with age comes
     <strong>
      wisdom
     </strong>
     . However, as the world population
     <strong>
      ages
     </strong>
     , will there be enough people to replace our younger selves?
    </p>
    <p>
     A situation where there are more old people than young certainly has an effect on the world. A report by the Pew Research Center says that globally the number of people over 65 years old will triple by 2050, drastically altering some countries’
     <strong>
      demographic make-up
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     This growing and
     <strong>
      dependent
     </strong>
     population means that there is an increased demand for health and
     <strong>
      social care
     </strong>
     . Governments will struggle to provide satisfactory
     <strong>
      pensions
     </strong>
     , which are ultimately funded by taxes paid by the
     <strong>
      working population
     </strong>
     . And long-term, a smaller population of economically-active people may be a problem for companies trying to recruit staff.
    </p>
    <p>
     Attitudes to an
     <strong>
      ageing population
     </strong>
     vary around the world. The Pew Research Center survey found that 87% of Japanese people were most concerned about it, while only 26% of people from the USA were. Here, immigration is helping to boost the younger workforce. Some countries thought
     <strong>
      the elderly
     </strong>
     should take care of themselves, while others thought it was the responsibility of the family. Many thought the government should be responsible.
    </p>
    <p>
     But
     <strong>
      old age
     </strong>
     shouldn’t just be seen negatively. Elderly people have knowledge and experience they can
     <strong>
      pass on
     </strong>
     . Some have wealth which they can spend, helping the economy. And some help society by doing voluntary or charity work. Of course, solutions are needed to tackle the issue, and these include increasing the
     <strong>
      retirement age
     </strong>
     , encouraging people to save for the future, persuading skilled and educated migrants to fill labour shortages, or even convincing people to have more children.
