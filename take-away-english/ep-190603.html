     乘飞机出行从未像现在这样普遍、这样受欢迎。目前，每年全球航空旅客量已超过 40 亿人次。但是航空碳排放会影响气候变化。科学家们说，我们需要做出更多的努力来应对这个问题。本集《随身英语》讨论如何减少飞行对环境所带来的影响。

     For many people, flying is a great way to move quickly and easily from place to place. There are now four billion
     <strong>
      passengers
     </strong>
     flying every year. The
     <strong>
      aviation industry
     </strong>
     has expanded massively in recent years, with the growth of
     <strong>
      budget airlines
     </strong>
     opening up new destinations which we can now reach for
     <strong>
      peanuts
     </strong>
     ! But this worldwide appetite for travel comes
     <strong>
      at a price -
     </strong>
     it’s increasing
     <strong>
      carbon emissions
     </strong>
     , which is harming the planet we want to explore.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to a new study,
     <strong>
      air travel
     </strong>
     is one of the things that accounts for eight per cent of carbon emissions – much higher than was first thought. The US tops the rankings followed by China, Germany and India. Dr Arunima Malik from the University of Sydney, who's the lead author of the study, told the BBC that it’s richer people who are more responsible by spending more on
     <strong>
      high-carbon
     </strong>
     activities. He says "If you have
     <strong>
      visitors
     </strong>
     from high-income countries then they typically spend heavily on air travel, on shopping and
     <strong>
      hospitality
     </strong>
     where they go to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The World Travel and Tourism Council claims things are changing. A spokesman said "We've seen a growing number of hotels, airports and
     <strong>
      tour operators
     </strong>
     that have all become
     <strong>
      carbon neutral
     </strong>
     so there is a momentum (to change)." Becoming carbon neutral involves
     <strong>
      carbon offsetting
     </strong>
     , where
     <strong>
      tourists
     </strong>
     pay extra money in order to contribute to environmental projects that reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere – although some say it's just an excuse to continue polluting. Airline passengers can do this by paying an additional charge when they buy their ticket from participating airlines.
    </p>
    <p>
     Things are changing and from next year, airlines will be required to offset any increase in emissions beyond their 2020 levels by reducing emissions elsewhere. And there are other ways to reduce your carbon footprint when you
     <strong>
      take to the skies
     </strong>
     – you can sit in the cheap seats; studies have shown by
     <strong>
      flying in
     </strong>
     <strong>
      business
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      first class
     </strong>
     “your emissions are at least three times more than if you decided to
     <strong>
      travel in
     </strong>
     <strong>
      economy
     </strong>
     .” You can also travel from your local airport and
     <strong>
      pack light
     </strong>
     – reducing the weight of the aircraft. But some people might say this doesn’t tackle the bigger problem – and the best action is to take a
     <strong>
      grounded
     </strong>
     approach and not to fly at all.
