     与传统的室外农耕相比，垂直农业用地面积相对少得多，因此它最初被视为一种节省空间的创新种植方式。虽然人们曾认为这个种植方式前景大好，但如今它正面临威胁。垂直农场上的作物是在没有阳光的受控环境下、依靠LED灯光生长的，因此从一定程度上看，能源成本的上升导致了垂直农业的现状不容乐观。垂直农业是否已经走到了尽头？本期节目围绕这个话题展开讨论。

     Why do farmers grow
     <strong>
      crops
     </strong>
     outside in
     <strong>
      fields
     </strong>
     when we can
     <strong>
      stack
     </strong>
     them vertically? The idea of
     <strong>
      vertical farming
     </strong>
     was first proposed in 1999. It was seen as a way to save space, reduce
     <strong>
      air miles
     </strong>
     and transform old and abandoned buildings, like
     <strong>
      warehouses
     </strong>
     . In 2021, Fortune Business Insights valued the global vertical farming market at 3.47 billion dollars. Now, however, this industry is under threat, partly due to rising energy costs.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the magazine Science Focus, vertical farming gives ten times the
     <strong>
      yield
     </strong>
     of conventional outdoor farming. However, in order for crops to grow using this method, plants are placed in a
     <strong>
      controlled environment
     </strong>
     , grown not under the Sun, but under
     <strong>
      LED
     </strong>
     <strong>
      lights
     </strong>
     and watered with recycled water
     <strong>
      pumped
     </strong>
     on a
     <strong>
      closed-loop
     </strong>
     system.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately, energy prices have risen across the globe. Therefore, this
     <strong>
      reliance
     </strong>
     on electricity has meant the last few years have not been easy for the industry. Cindy van Rijswick, from the Dutch research firm RaboResearch, has estimated that
     <strong>
      operational costs
     </strong>
     for a vertical farm are around 15% higher now compared to 18 months ago. Infarm, Europe's largest vertical farming company,
     <strong>
      made
     </strong>
     around 500 employees
     <strong>
      redundant
     </strong>
     back in November 2022 because they needed to
     <strong>
      downsize
     </strong>
     . They blamed higher operating costs due to energy increases as one reason for the
     <strong>
      layoffs
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Another issue related to the
     <strong>
      cost-of-living crisis
     </strong>
     and affecting vertical farming is the type of
     <strong>
      produce
     </strong>
     grown. This includes herbs such as
     <strong>
      basil
     </strong>
     , as well as
     <strong>
      salad leaves
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      leafy greens
     </strong>
     . Compared to traditionally
     <strong>
      farmed
     </strong>
     ingredients, like onions and carrots, these products are more expensive so could be less in demand as consumers watch their spending more.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, it seems a future with food grown under LED lights is looking less and less bright.
