    <p>
     What would work be like if you had no boss? Imagine you could make all your own decisions and no one told you what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
     One company decided to find out if it could work. The staff at Crisp, a Swedish software
     <strong>
      consultancy
     </strong>
     , chose to
     <strong>
      get rid of
     </strong>
     their CEO and create a completely
     <strong>
      flat
     </strong>
     organisation. Having trialled several different
     <strong>
      management structures
     </strong>
     , the firm agreed to take the
     <strong>
      radical
     </strong>
     step of having no single leader.
    </p>
    <p>
     First, they needed to establish what a CEO actually did. Then they shared those duties out amongst staff and
     <strong>
      board members
     </strong>
     . Employee Yassal Sundman told the BBC: "When we looked at it we had nothing left in the CEO
     <strong>
      column
     </strong>
     , and we said, 'all right, why don't we try it out?'".
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is exactly what they did. And Crisp employee, Heinrik Kniberg, believes it’s been a good move. He says the company can now act faster: "If you want to get something done, you stand up and start
     <strong>
      driving
     </strong>
     that". Kniberg also claims workers are more
     <strong>
      motivated
     </strong>
     . Crisp regularly measures staff satisfaction, and say they average over four out of five.
    </p>
    <p>
     Any big decisions are made during the
     <strong>
      company-wide
     </strong>
     four-day meetings several times a year. They do still have a board: it’s a
     <strong>
      legal requirement
     </strong>
     . But the board can be used as a
     <strong>
      last resort
     </strong>
     to resolve tricky issues.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if it’s working out for Crisp, could this model become more widespread? Online retailer Zappos tried out a similar plan but had
     <strong>
      mixed results
     </strong>
     . Almost a fifth of Zappos staff decided to leave, and chief executive Tony Hsieh admitted that "self-management is not for everyone".
    </p>
    <p>
     Founder of file-sharing service Dropbox, Drew Houston, believes that a
     <strong>
      leaderless
     </strong>
     structure is too chaotic.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Often infinite freedom like that can be pretty
     <strong>
      disorientating
     </strong>
     . It doesn't always feel good, because you no longer know what you're supposed to do, what's important and you're
     <strong>
      bumping up against
     </strong>
     <strong>
      other people
     </strong>
     ," Mr Houston says.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what is the perfect balance? How do you keep
     <strong>
      accountability
     </strong>
     in a company without
     <strong>
      hierarchy
     </strong>
     ? Would you like to work somewhere with no boss?
