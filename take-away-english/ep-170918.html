     <strong>
      Let's be honest
     </strong>
     – I'm sure we've all done something a little
     <strong>
      dishonest
     </strong>
     in our lives – maybe copying someone's work, borrowing some money from a friend and not paying them back or being given too much change in a shop and keeping quiet about it. Or maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're a good,
     <strong>
      upstanding
     </strong>
     citizen who believes that
     <strong>
      honesty is the best policy
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     This proverb, 'honesty is the best policy', was written back in the 1700s by American statesman, Benjamin Franklin. We may agree that
     <strong>
      owning up
     </strong>
     to our mistakes and behaving in a genuine and
     <strong>
      decent
     </strong>
     way, is the right way to lead our lives but is there something in our human nature that makes us
     <strong>
      unscrupulous
     </strong>
     ? For example, in some shops and car parks you can find an
     <strong>
      honesty box
     </strong>
     – a box where you pay for something by putting money in it – but it relies on you putting the right amount of cash in. This relies on people being honest and not trying to
     <strong>
      cheat
     </strong>
     but it does provide a
     <strong>
      temptation
     </strong>
     to get away with not paying the full amount.
    </p>
    <p>
     Philip Graves, a psychologist, and author of the book Consumerology, suggests that this temptation is part of our
     <strong>
      evolution
     </strong>
     . He says: "We have evolved with the
     <strong>
      capacity
     </strong>
     to be dishonest. It's part of our
     <strong>
      evolutionary psychological make up
     </strong>
     – because if we can gain an advantage over the people around us, we have a greater chance of surviving."
    </p>
    <p>
     So why do we place such importance on being honest if we
     <strong>
      benefit
     </strong>
     from being dishonest? It's because it is
     <strong>
      selfish
     </strong>
     behaviour – which other members of our social group won't like. If everybody acted selfishly and dishonestly all the time, the world would be a very unpleasant place. As Philip Graves says: "There is a balance to strike between the extent to which we can
     <strong>
      feather our own nest
     </strong>
     , so to speak, and the risk of being
     <strong>
      ostracised
     </strong>
     by the group." So, for societies to work together we need to trust each other and therefore we need to be honest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being
     <strong>
      trustworthy
     </strong>
     with money is of course crucial for an economy to survive and there are laws to protect us from dishonest practices like corruption and
     <strong>
      fraud
     </strong>
     . But being honest with words is another matter; saying what we think to someone can
     <strong>
      get us
     </strong>
     <strong>
      into hot water
     </strong>
     . However a new anonymous messaging app has been designed that lets anyone with a link to your profile to send you a message without knowing who it's from. The app now has 300 million users which perhaps indicates how honest we really like to be – but
     <strong>
      in all honesty
     </strong>
     , do you want to know what people think about you? Is honesty always the best policy?!
