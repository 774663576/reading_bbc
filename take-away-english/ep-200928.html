     近来，在英国，新冠肺炎疫情的封锁让一些人开始寻找其它途径来获取自己的食物。这包括在阳台上的小花盆里种植蔬菜，或者租用一小块地来自己种植蔬菜水果。本文讨论自己种植食物的好处。

     We all need to eat, and when we go to buy food at the supermarket, we’re spoilt for choice in the range of items available that can be turned into a delicious meal. But we often purchase food that’s been
     <strong>
      mass-produced
     </strong>
     and that’s travelled many miles before it ends up on our plate. So for some, growing their own food is a better option – and it tastes good too!
    </p>
    <p>
     From growing vegetables in little
     <strong>
      pots
     </strong>
     on your balcony to
     <strong>
      tending
     </strong>
     to a small
     <strong>
      plot
     </strong>
     of land, called
     <strong>
      allotments
     </strong>
     , there are many ways to produce home-grown food. Allotments are a typically British idea, and they give people with a small or no garden, a space to
     <strong>
      plant
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      nurture
     </strong>
     fruit and vegetables. It can be
     <strong>
      backbreaking
     </strong>
     work
     <strong>
      digging
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      weeding
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      watering
     </strong>
     the soil, but the result is fresh,
     <strong>
      organically
     </strong>
     grown
     <strong>
      produce
     </strong>
     , contributing to our ‘five-a-day’ diet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The recent Covid-19 pandemic lockdown means demand for allotments has seen a renaissance. Miriam Dobson from the University of Sheffield told the BBC that people with allotments have been spending a lot of their time on their plots, growing plenty of fresh
     <strong>
      fruit and veg
     </strong>
     – which, at times, have been challenging to source in supermarkets. She says “Coronavirus has… highlighted to people the fragility inherent within our globalised food system. In a time of crisis, interest in
     <strong>
      self-sufficiency
     </strong>
     rises.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But for those with limited space, a solution to grow your own veg lies closer to home – using pots. Once you can lay your hands on some
     <strong>
      compost
     </strong>
     , you can plant
     <strong>
      seeds
     </strong>
     . Sheila Brand lives in a third-floor flat in Rotterdam. She has managed to grow tomatoes and aubergines and is already
     <strong>
      harvesting
     </strong>
     raspberries. She told the BBC watching the plants grow “is very exciting: 'Oh it's got a new leaf!' ”
    </p>
    <p>
     As well as the benefits of saving money and enjoying tasty food, gardener Mark Ridsdill-Smith says “growing your own from a balcony or window ledge not only improves your wellbeing and immediate environment, you can actually grow a lot of veg.” So, maybe it’s time for us all to get planting and develop our
     <strong>
      green fingers
     </strong>
