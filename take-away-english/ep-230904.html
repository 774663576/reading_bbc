     It's summer, so it's a great time to be outdoors. One way of letting your hair down and enjoying the fresh air is to attend a music
     <strong>
      festival
     </strong>
     , where you can enjoy seeing your favourite
     <strong>
      musicians
     </strong>
     perform. But it's not just about the music – there are other activities to enjoy. And of course, it's a chance to spend time with your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     People have always enjoyed
     <strong>
      communal
     </strong>
     gatherings – even in prehistoric times, people would come together, have
     <strong>
      feasts
     </strong>
     and celebrate – and part of the occasion involved playing or listening to music. So, music festivals are nothing new. But they have evolved, and in recent times, one of the most famous music festivals was
     <strong>
      Woodstock
     </strong>
     in the USA in 1969. This
     <strong>
      al fresco
     </strong>
     event was one of the largest ever to be
     <strong>
      staged
     </strong>
     and promised 'three days of peace and music'. It attracted a large '
     <strong>
      hippie
     </strong>
     ' crowd. And in 1970, the
     <strong>
      Glastonbury
     </strong>
     festival began on a farm in the UK and now spreads across 900 acres of land. It has become a highlight in a
     <strong>
      festival goers
     </strong>
     ' music calendar, attracting major
     <strong>
      headline acts
     </strong>
     and large crowds who camp out for the weekend. Although they often have to endure rain and mud!
    </p>
    <p>
     Other festivals that have become huge include the
     <strong>
      Danube Island Festival
     </strong>
     in Austria, the
     <strong>
      Mawazine
     </strong>
     Festival in Morocco, the Isle of Wight Festival in the UK, and
     <strong>
      Coachella
     </strong>
     in the USA – a music and arts festival that features every
     <strong>
      genre
     </strong>
     of music. But from the
     <strong>
      mainstream
     </strong>
     to the
     <strong>
      niche
     </strong>
     , there seems to be a festival for everyone taking place around the world. And festivals have become
     <strong>
      big business
     </strong>
     too. According to research by Festicket in 2018, the music festival industry was worth $3bn (£2.28bn) globally, and it has continued to grow. Many events have become
     <strong>
      commercialised
     </strong>
     . Ticket prices are high and
     <strong>
      corporations
     </strong>
     and social media
     <strong>
      influencers
     </strong>
     cash in on festival themes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite all of this, for many
     <strong>
      hedonistic
     </strong>
     young people, attending a festival has become
     <strong>
      a rite of passage
     </strong>
     and a shared experience that can't be missed. Writing for BBC Culture, Arwa Haider says "for any generation, they're unlike any other place on earth: a site liberated from everyday rules, where we might bond with strangers and stumble across new sounds and
     <strong>
      sensations
     </strong>
     ."
