     一提到博物馆，不少人会想到 “国家博物馆”、“古代历史博物馆”、“艺术博物馆” 等常见的字眼。这类规模甚大的博物馆内通常陈列着和特定艺术、历史和文化有关的经典展品。但有一些博物馆则不遵循惯例，它们致力于收藏古怪而离奇的展品。幸好每个人的兴趣和品味都不同，所以总有那么一个能激起你的兴趣！本集《随身英语》介绍一些小众博物馆。

     What comes to mind when you think of a museum? Perhaps you picture an imposing building in a rather
     <strong>
      traditional
     </strong>
     design made of high-quality stone? Perhaps you imagine one of the
     <strong>
      classic
     </strong>
     concepts, such as the museum of natural history, the museum of fine art, or the national museum - its exhibits displayed in a
     <strong>
      time-honoured
     </strong>
     style and
     <strong>
      falling in line with convention
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people might consider these
     <strong>
      customary
     </strong>
     institutions the best way to safeguard the future of
     <strong>
      typical
     </strong>
     educational topics. A museum of antique breadboards, they may say, does not constitute an
     <strong>
      orthodox
     </strong>
     or legitimate exhibition. But according to the Museums Association, a museum is defined as a place enabling "…people to explore collections for inspiration, learning and enjoyment."  And so of the 2500 estimated museums in the UK, a few are bound to be considered a little
     <strong>
      unconventional
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      eccentric
     </strong>
     or even
     <strong>
      niche
     </strong>
     . No matter how
     <strong>
      atypical
     </strong>
     your interest, there's a museum for you!
    </p>
    <p>
     What about Neil Cole's Adventures in Science Fiction? This
     <strong>
      quirky
     </strong>
     museum of classic science fiction was opened by founder Neil Cole. Visitors to this Allendale attraction in Northumberland can see items ranging from props used in the BBC series Dr Who to part of Thor's costume from the Avengers movie. "Science fiction has become more
     <strong>
      mainstream
     </strong>
     so I thought people might want to see this," says Mr Cole.
    </p>
    <p>
     If clocks are more to your taste, why not visit the Cuckooland Museum? Set up by brothers Roman and Maz Piekarski, this Cheshire collection of over 600 cuckoo clocks is considered to be the largest of its kind in the world – and all from the Black Forest region in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, you could visit the Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities in London. This
     <strong>
      offbeat
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      alternative
     </strong>
     institution
     <strong>
      bucks the trend
     </strong>
     of educating visitors through written explanations alongside its curios. Instead, it displays all of its
     <strong>
      kooky
     </strong>
     treasures, which include dodo bones, shrunken heads and a collection of McDonald's Happy Meal toys, with no explanation at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     These are just a few examples. There are many more wonderful institutions out there that
     <strong>
      march to the beat of their own drum
     </strong>
     . All you have to do is go and find them!
