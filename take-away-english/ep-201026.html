     火星一直是科幻小说的主题。关于火星上是否存在生命、水甚至文明的理论一直存在。现在，人类似乎离登陆火星的日子越来越近，但我们究竟为什么要去火星呢？

     It sounds like something from the realms of
     <strong>
      science fiction
     </strong>
     – a
     <strong>
      space expedition
     </strong>
     into the
     <strong>
      vast expanse
     </strong>
     of space, heading towards
     <strong>
      the Red Planet
     </strong>
     . While we’re not quite ready to put a person on
     <strong>
      terra firma
     </strong>
     , the question we ask today is: why are so many countries interested in going to Mars?
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <strong>
      space race
     </strong>
     saw the USA and USSR compete to achieve firsts in
     <strong>
      spaceflight
     </strong>
     . The Soviet Union released Sputnik 1, an
     <strong>
      artificial satellite
     </strong>
     , before anyone else, and the US landed on the Moon first. Now it appears that Mars is the
     <strong>
      celestial body
     </strong>
     of desire. While the kudos and bragging rights to be the first nation to
     <strong>
      touchdown
     </strong>
     is an obvious draw, there are other reasons we want to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of these could be the survival of our
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     . You only have to look at the fossilised remains of the dinosaurs to see the benefit of finding another
     <strong>
      habitable
     </strong>
     planet. While Mars doesn’t have the right conditions to call it home just yet, there’s always the concept of
     <strong>
      terraforming
     </strong>
     – changing the environment of a planet to suit our needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, not everyone agrees. Leading
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      strophysicist
     </strong>
     Neil deGrasse Tyson has said the concept of altering
     <strong>
      habitability
     </strong>
     of another planet because of the damage we have done to
     <strong>
      Earth
     </strong>
     makes no sense when we can simply terraform Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems the main reason at the moment is the search for
     <strong>
      extraterrestrial
     </strong>
     life. It has long been believed that, at one time, Mars was abundant with life. Now seemingly dead, the potential fossils could answer questions about our own evolution and that of our planet. One theory is that
     <strong>
      bacterial life
     </strong>
     on our planet didn’t start here, but was transferred via
     <strong>
      asteroid
     </strong>
     from Mars.
    </p>
    <p>
     One benefit championed by scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson is that landing on Mars may inspire more people to become interested in science and
     <strong>
      astronomy.
     </strong>
     Surely inspiring a new generation to visit the stars is reason enough.
