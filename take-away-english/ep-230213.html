     Most of us would agree that being healthy is important. We are
     <strong>
      inundated
     </strong>
     with articles in health magazines talking about the latest
     <strong>
      fad
     </strong>
     diets, or adverts that offer potential
     <strong>
      miracle cures
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      obesity
     </strong>
     that are often
     <strong>
      too good to be true
     </strong>
     . One of the latest
     <strong>
      crazes
     </strong>
     is fasting, often referred to as
     <strong>
      intermittent fasting
     </strong>
     . But what is it? And how can it help us to lose weight?
    </p>
    <p>
     Fasting refers to a period of
     <strong>
      abstinence
     </strong>
     from
     <strong>
      consuming
     </strong>
     food. The idea of intermittent fasting is to reduce calories over a certain number of days or hours rather than a sustained period. It has been linked to
     <strong>
      longevity
     </strong>
     and generally improved health. It also helps those interested in
     <strong>
      keeping off the weight
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      dropping a few
     </strong>
     <strong>
      pounds
     </strong>
     . There are also different ways to fast. For example, in the 5:2 diet, you eat normally on five days of a week and reduce your calorie
     <strong>
      intake
     </strong>
     on the other two. Then there's a restricted-hours diet that sees people only eating during a limited part of the day, for example, over eight hours. But is it for everyone? Well, before we get to that, let's look at some of the possible benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
     A study published on the National Library of Medicine website suggests that intermittent fasting may help with the control of
     <strong>
      blood sugar
     </strong>
     and potentially lower the risk of diabetes. However, more research on this is needed. Other studies have claimed that some form of intermittent fasting may help to prevent some diseases, aid with
     <strong>
      metabolism
     </strong>
     , slow the
     <strong>
      ageing process
     </strong>
     , support
     <strong>
      brain function
     </strong>
     , and help to
     <strong>
      shed weight
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And what about the downsides? Well, this diet is not for everyone. Fasting might not suit those who are
     <strong>
      underweight
     </strong>
     or with a long-term medical condition. Fasting may cause some people to experience symptoms such as headaches or make them
     <strong>
      prone
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     <strong>
      overeating
     </strong>
     after a reduced calorie intake day. As with many diets, it's always wise to speak to your doctor or weight loss professional before changing your eating habits. And, at the end of the day, it could just come down to what lifestyle choice suits you.
