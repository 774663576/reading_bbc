     人类有着复杂多样的情感，动物也一样吗？研究表明，不论大小，每种体型的动物都能体会到某种感受。我们是否应更具同理心？本期 “随身英语” 节目围绕这一问题展开讨论。

     When you encounter animals, do you wonder what they’re thinking? Seeing a newborn lamb or a cute puppy might
     <strong>
      stir up
     </strong>
     happy
     <strong>
      emotions
     </strong>
     in us, but what are they thinking? Does the look on their face and how they behave indicate how they’re
     <strong>
      feeling
     </strong>
     – or are they feeling nothing at all?
    </p>
    <p>
     Humans have
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     complex
     <strong>
      range of
     </strong>
     emotions, but it’s hard to tell what’s going on inside the heads of animals, mainly because they can’t
     <strong>
      verbalise
     </strong>
     their
     <strong>
      feelings
     </strong>
     . Perhaps it’s pets we think we understand most – as they are the animals we spend a lot of time with and therefore get to know best. Some of us own dogs because they are good
     <strong>
      companions
     </strong>
     , are loyal and seem to
     <strong>
      connect with
     </strong>
     us. We might even think they love us, although love could just be a human emotion. Professor Kim Bard, an expert in comparative developmental psychology from the University of Portsmouth, told the BBC: “We have a few studies now that actually show, scientifically… that [some] dogs will respond with
     <strong>
      empathetic concern
     </strong>
     when their owner – but not a stranger – pretends to cry.” The empathetic ability of cats, however, is harder to work out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other non-domesticated animals might have feelings too. Giraffes and whales, for example, are known to
     <strong>
      experience grief
     </strong>
     when someone in their group dies. Farm animals we often eat, such as cows and chickens, are also believed to experience
     <strong>
      pain
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      joy
     </strong>
     and other emotions. Their wellbeing is now taken into consideration more. And in the UK, new legislation means all vertebrate animals and crustaceans will be recognised in law as
     <strong>
      sentient
     </strong>
     beings. It’s believed even tiny creatures like insects might have emotions as well. Research is beginning to show they experience a wide range of feelings. Writing for BBC Future website, Zaria Gorvett says “they can be
     <strong>
      optimistic
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      cynical
     </strong>
     , or
     <strong>
      frightened
     </strong>
     , and respond to pain just like any mammal would.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr Barbara J King, Emerita Professor of Anthropology at the College of William and Mary, told the BBC: “If we understand the profound depths of emotions animals can feel, this should make us question the existence of zoos and slaughterhouses around the world, and rethink those systems.” It does seem all creatures feel emotion, but what is not clear is do they feel the same way as us?
