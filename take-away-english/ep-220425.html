    <p>
     For many of us, online shopping has made the process of purchasing goods a far simpler and more
     <strong>
      fluid
     </strong>
     process. No longer do we have to
     <strong>
      head
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     the shops to
     <strong>
      browse
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      peruse
     </strong>
     various objects,
     <strong>
      wandering round
     </strong>
     endless
     <strong>
      aisles
     </strong>
     , before finally
     <strong>
      settling for
     </strong>
     the first thing we saw. These days, we find the item we want or need online,
     <strong>
      click on
     </strong>
     it, and check out its
     <strong>
      description
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      user reviews
     </strong>
     . If it
     <strong>
      fits the bill
     </strong>
     , we send it to our
     <strong>
      basket
     </strong>
     and pay. There seems to be
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      wealth of options
     </strong>
     <strong>
      at our fingertips
     </strong>
     . But how do we know the options that
     <strong>
      pop up
     </strong>
     in front of us really are the best deals. And how might
     <strong>
      algorithms
     </strong>
     help or
     <strong>
      hinder
     </strong>
     us?
    </p>
    <p>
     Algorithms, simply put, are mathematical instructions which tell the computer how to solve problems. When shopping is involved, what is the problem they solve? Well, the algorithms instruct the computer which
     <strong>
      adverts
     </strong>
     to show and which products a user is most likely to
     <strong>
      splash the cash
     </strong>
     on. By analysing things we’ve previously bought or looked at, the algorithm can predict what
     <strong>
      goods
     </strong>
     we’re most likely to be
     <strong>
      enticed
     </strong>
     by. For some people, the idea of something guessing your preferences could sound a bit intimidating. But first, let’s look at the positives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Time is an important thing – something we don’t want to waste too much of. By telling the computer to show us adverts for things we are interested in, it can save us a lot of time
     <strong>
      sifting through
     </strong>
     things or services that don’t match our criteria. They can also help us find the best deals.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, there are some people who have concerns about the impact of algorithms on our shopping experience. It is possible that algorithms may only select options from a limited number of
     <strong>
      brands
     </strong>
     , or may favour products from certain companies. There are also concerns that we aren’t always shown the cheapest or best deal, even though that’s what we’re searching for. Finally, some algorithms generate ads which tell you there are only a limited number of items you’re interested in left. They might just be there to manipulate you.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the takeaway from this is that algorithms are here to stay, and it’s wise to know they exist. Whenever you’re shopping, be it online or off, make sure to
     <strong>
      shop around
     </strong>
     for the best deals. The first thing you see might not always be the best for you.
