     How good are you at maths? Some people love the challenge of
     <strong>
      algebra
     </strong>
     or enjoy working out number
     <strong>
      puzzles
     </strong>
     such as
     <strong>
      Sudoko
     </strong>
     . Maths is all around us, from working out how to
     <strong>
      split the bill
     </strong>
     after a meal, to
     <strong>
      calculating
     </strong>
     your household bills. But many dread the moment when they have to deal with numbers and
     <strong>
      figures
     </strong>
     and feel a real sense of worry and confusion. It can seem daunting, but this ‘
     <strong>
      maths anxiety
     </strong>
     ’ is perfectly normal, and you’re definitely not alone. And anyway, our worries and fears don’t necessarily reflect our
     <strong>
      ability
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The problem really starts in childhood, at school. Research has found that maths teachers who are
     <strong>
      nervous
     </strong>
     about teaching the subject can pass on their anxiety to the pupils, and girls may be more likely to be affected. The Programme for International Student Assessment found around 31% of 15 and 16-year-olds across 34 countries said they got very nervous doing maths
     <strong>
      problems
     </strong>
     , 33% said they got tense doing maths
     <strong>
      homework
     </strong>
     , and nearly 60% said they worried maths classes would be difficult. Shulamit Kahn, from Boston University’s Questrom School of Business, told the BBC she believes giving students, particularly girls, good
     <strong>
      role models
     </strong>
     “is critical, especially at a young age”. She thinks the key is to get people, especially women, who love teaching maths to younger children.
    </p>
    <p>
     Writing for BBC Future, David Robson says “It’s not clear why maths arouses so much fear compared to geography. But the fact that there’s a right or wrong answer – there’s no room for
     <strong>
      bluffing
     </strong>
     – might make you more worried about
     <strong>
      underperforming
     </strong>
     .” And once we assume we’re not a ‘maths person’, we avoid
     <strong>
      solving
     </strong>
     things that we probably could do.
    </p>
    <p>
     Psychologists have been trying to work out why
     <strong>
      mental arithmetic
     </strong>
     can bring us out in a sweat. That seed of fear may come from many sources, but some suggest that
     <strong>
      articulating
     </strong>
     your fears can loosen their hold on you, and encourage children to see a maths test as a
     <strong>
      challenge
     </strong>
     , not a threat. Ideally, we need to think positively about maths and give it
     <strong>
      a second chance
     </strong>
     .
