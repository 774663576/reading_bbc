     民航业虽然是对环境污染最多的行业之一，却依然在蓬勃发展。这是因为其它对环境相对友好的远途旅行方式常常有速度慢、不方便、价格高等问题。比如，英国城市伦敦和爱丁堡之间虽然只有 600 多公里，但由于坐飞机价格低廉、耗时短，许多人依然选择放弃乘坐舒适环保的火车往返。我们能否转向更绿色的出行交通方式？有哪些好的选项？本文就此展开讨论。

     Flying has
     <strong>
      revolutionised
     </strong>
     the way we navigate the world. It's often the quickest and most convenient way to travel long distances. But there's
     <strong>
      a catch
     </strong>
     – it's one of the most
     <strong>
      carbon-intensive
     </strong>
     activities the average person is likely to do. In 2018, a small group of celebrities in Sweden led the 'flygskam' movement, meaning '
     <strong>
      flight shame
     </strong>
     ' in English, to encourage people to give up flying. But, for people who need or love to travel, what can we offer as
     <strong>
      green
     </strong>
     alternatives?
    </p>
    <p>
     For medium to long-distance travel, it seems trains are our
     <strong>
      best bet
     </strong>
     . Using a train instead of a
     <strong>
      domestic flight
     </strong>
     reduces emissions by 86%, according to the 2023 article 'Which form of transport has the smallest
     <strong>
      carbon footprint
     </strong>
     ?'. A downside is that trains can be more expensive than flying with low-cost
     <strong>
      airlines
     </strong>
     . Another is that it might take hours longer to reach your
     <strong>
      destination
     </strong>
     , and most people don't want to spend a large part of their trip travelling
     <strong>
      from A to B
     </strong>
     . That's where
     <strong>
      sleeper trains
     </strong>
     come in. European
     <strong>
      rail networks
     </strong>
     are expanding, which means
     <strong>
      passengers
     </strong>
     can travel while sleeping and wake up in a new city or country!
    </p>
    <p>
     For shorter distances, many would be willing to swap cars for bicycles, but few would consider cycling internationally. Among those few, Matilda Welin. It took her 17 days to cycle from London to Sweden. Sadly, she concluded that her trip neither benefitted the planet nor saved her money. But, it did change her perspective. She says "As I
     <strong>
      pedalled
     </strong>
     , I felt I was experiencing the true distance of the journey I take so casually and so often with a plane." She describes how the world around her changed slowly; the languages, the architecture, the landscapes – something she wouldn't have appreciated on a flight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately for the planet, air travel remains a popular option – around 100,000 planes take off globally per day. But, further investment in rail
     <strong>
      infrastructure
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      subsidising
     </strong>
     ticket fares could help get more people on trains than planes.
