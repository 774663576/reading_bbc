     We have so much stuff to carry around these days – mobile phones, keys, credit cards and laptops. Some of us might stuff them into various pockets in our clothes and others will put them in a bag. For women this might be a
     <strong>
      practical
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      trendy
     </strong>
     handbag. But how are men supposed to carry things around and look
     <strong>
      cool
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     The answer is a manbag! They are
     <strong>
      the height of fashion
     </strong>
     at the moment – a stylish
     <strong>
      accessory
     </strong>
     that modern men are carrying around. I'm a little cynical about these
     <strong>
      must-have
     </strong>
     items – let's face it, a manbag by any other name is a bag and I have one - my trusty
     <strong>
      backpack
     </strong>
     . However, senior fashion analyst for market research company Mintel, Tamara Senders, describes a manbag as "a bag worn by men, including backpacks and other styles such as
     <strong>
      shoulder bags
     </strong>
     ." I can't see my old backpack being a
     <strong>
      style icon
     </strong>
     , but maybe I'm just not
     <strong>
      on-trend
     </strong>
     : According to Mintel, 15 per cent of men bought one in the UK last year.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it's the name that's putting me off. Why does a bag have to have a gender? I suppose they're being marketed as a stylish fashion item designed to look good on men. I've heard that many big names have flocked to
     <strong>
      adopt the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      trend
     </strong>
     . Pharrell Williams, David Beckham and Kanye West, are just some of those who've been spotted
     <strong>
      rocking
     </strong>
     a manbag.
    </p>
    <p>
     My reservations about being seen carrying one may be down to my Britishness. According to Nick Carvell, the Contributing Fashion Editor for GQ magazine: "In Britain we are still very tied up with that idea of
     <strong>
      masculinity
     </strong>
     that is almost so fragile that it can be dented by
     <strong>
      carrying a bag
     </strong>
     ." So, while some British men might think a manbag to be
     <strong>
      effeminate
     </strong>
     and not very '
     <strong>
      macho
     </strong>
     ', he thinks that many Europeans don't have an issue with toting such a fashionable item.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, if I was to exchange my old backpack for a manbag, it would
     <strong>
      come at a price
     </strong>
     . With people like Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Gucci and Dolce and Gabbana designing these bags, they can come with
     <strong>
      a hefty price tag
     </strong>
     . I suppose that's the price of fashion! And apparently, if I had any spare cash, I could complete my
     <strong>
      designer outfit
     </strong>
     by buying a murse – that's a man's purse!
    </p>
    <p>
     I suppose fashions change and we have come a long way from the days when men carried their things in a very masculine
     <strong>
      briefcase
     </strong>
     - sturdy, sensible and practical. Now, it seems, we have to put as much thought into buying a bag as we do into buying our clothes.
