     你想要一个轻松的减肥方法吗？既不用去健身房锻炼，也不需要在游泳池里游无数个来回？一项研究在比较了运动锻炼和泡热水澡的相对益处后发现，通过泡热水澡消耗的卡路里和快步走消耗的热量是一样，而且，饭后泡澡比运动能更多地降低血糖含量。在本期《随身英语》里，我们探讨为什么泡个热气腾腾的澡对你的健康有益。

     课文内容
    </h3>
    <p>
     <strong>
      词汇:
      <em>
       Exercise 锻炼
      </em>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     You might think that to lose weight you need to do
     <strong>
      strenuous
     </strong>
     exercise – pedalling furiously on an exercise bike, for example, or doing
     <strong>
      lengths
     </strong>
     in your local pool. Well, you may be pleasantly surprised to learn that lying in a steaming bath can bring the same benefits as exercise, without the need to sweat
     <strong>
      profusely
     </strong>
     in the gym!
    </p>
    <p>
     These were the findings of an experiment comparing the relative benefits of exercise and hot baths that was carried out by Dr Steve Faulkner of Loughborough University. The volunteers first lay in a hot bath and then ate a light meal, while their blood sugar level was
     <strong>
      monitored
     </strong>
     and the number of calories they burnt was measured. The experiment was then repeated, but instead of having a bath, the participants did an hour’s
     <strong>
      vigorous
     </strong>
     exercise on a bike. The results from both activities were compared with unexpected results.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What we found”, said Dr Faulkner, “was an 80% increase in energy
     <strong>
      expenditure
     </strong>
     , just as a result of sitting in the bath for the course of an hour”. You burn 140 calories – not as many perhaps as if you had
     <strong>
      worked out
     </strong>
     on an exercise bike, but the same number as if you had been on a
     <strong>
      brisk
     </strong>
     walk. The real surprise, however, came in the blood sugar level results. The peak
     <strong>
      glucose
     </strong>
     output, the amount of blood sugar in the blood after a meal, was on average10% lower after the bath compared to that after exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr Faulkner’s explanation for this
     <strong>
      phenomenon
     </strong>
     is that when you are in a hot bath, proteins, known as ‘heat shock proteins’ are released, which help
     <strong>
      divert
     </strong>
     the sugar from the bloodstream to the muscles. It’s important to keep blood sugar levels down to avoid damage to the
     <strong>
      arteries
     </strong>
     and nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Don’t think, though, that you can hang up your trainers just yet! You should aim to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-
     <strong>
      intensity
     </strong>
     exercise a week. But, if you are one of those people who need to control their blood sugar levels – if you have type-2
     <strong>
      diabetes
     </strong>
     for example or find it hard to exercise – why wait? Grab a towel and start running the hot tap!
