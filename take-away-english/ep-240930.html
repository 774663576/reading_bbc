     Imagine sitting down for dinner in ancient Babylon. What would be on the menu? Thanks to clay tablets discovered over a century ago, we're starting to find out. These tablets, written around 4,000 years ago, were originally thought to be about medicine. But in the 1980s, scholars realised that these texts were actually
     <strong>
      recipes
     </strong>
     . "Out of hundreds of thousands of
     <strong>
      cuneiform
     </strong>
     documents, they are the only food recipes that exist" says Agnete Lassen, associate curator of the Yale Babylonian collection. This means they offer a rare glimpse into the
     <strong>
      culinary
     </strong>
     world of this ancient region of Mesopotamia, now modern-day Iraq.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems the cooks of that time were expected to know what they were doing – the instructions are
     <strong>
      straight to the point
     </strong>
     , and the amounts of the
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     are not specified. Despite this, modern researchers have been recreating and
     <strong>
      taste-testing
     </strong>
     the ancient dishes. One recipe that has been successfully recreated is a
     <strong>
      stew
     </strong>
     called 'tuh'u'. The dish starts with water and
     <strong>
      seared
     </strong>
     lamb. Then, in go salt, beer, some vegetables, and for a
     <strong>
      fiery
     </strong>
     taste, garlic and
     <strong>
      coriander
     </strong>
     . It's a favourite among researchers: "It's
     <strong>
      pungent
     </strong>
     and it's very nicely
     <strong>
      spiced
     </strong>
     " says Agnete Lassen, "It has good
     <strong>
      flavours
     </strong>
     ." Another dish turned out so unbearably
     <strong>
      bitter
     </strong>
     that none of the other
     <strong>
      seasonings
     </strong>
     could be detected, so either the translation was incorrect, or people's tastes were very different back then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Interestingly, all the recipes discovered are for making stews and
     <strong>
      broths
     </strong>
     , observes Iraqi food historian, Nawal Nasrallah. Stew remained a tradition in medieval Iraq and continues to be a
     <strong>
      staple
     </strong>
     of modern Iraqi food. On the other hand, other ancient flavours have disappeared. For example, a Roman fish sauce called 'garam' was a
     <strong>
      potent
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      fermented
     </strong>
     sauce with an
     <strong>
      umami
     </strong>
     flavour. It was once popular but is now not a common feature of modern Italian
     <strong>
      cuisine
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     How many of our own culinary traditions will survive years from now? Will future generations taste what we taste today, or will our favourite dishes become forgotten?
