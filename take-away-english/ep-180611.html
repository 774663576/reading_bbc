     虽然女性已经探索太空多年，但登上太空的男性人数仍高于女性。美国航天局希望能组建一支性别平衡的队伍。顶级航天工程师们认为第一个踏上火星的人应该是一名女性。本集《随身英语》探讨太空事业中缺少女性工作者的原因。

     There's no doubt that one of the greatest achievements by
     <strong>
      humankind
     </strong>
     is the
     <strong>
      exploration
     </strong>
     of space. Ever since
     <strong>
      cosmonaut
     </strong>
     Yuri Gagarin became the first person to journey into space in 1961, scientists have been exploring it and
     <strong>
      pushing the boundaries
     </strong>
     to try and go further and discover things that are yet to be discovered. But probably the only thing that's certain about this exploration into the unknown so far, is it's been dominated by men.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, in the past, women haven't been excluded from space projects. Women have been involved on the ground at
     <strong>
      mission control
     </strong>
     – and behind the scenes women have worked as seamstresses, stitching vital
     <strong>
      spaceflight
     </strong>
     <strong>
      components
     </strong>
     . In fact, many of
     <strong>
      NASA
     </strong>
     's key
     <strong>
      missions
     </strong>
     would never have left the ground without them. And it was a group of black female
     <strong>
      mathematicians
     </strong>
     , recently depicted in a Hollywood movie called Hidden Figures, who helped NASA launch an American into space.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this hasn't been women's only contribution. Back in 1963, Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova became the first woman to
     <strong>
      blast off
     </strong>
     into space. However, after that, space flight programmes were slow to employ women.  In the USA, NASA didn't accept applications from women to become
     <strong>
      astronauts
     </strong>
     until 1978, and as missions to the Moon had ended by then, it meant Neil Armstrong's arrival on
     <strong>
      the Moon
     </strong>
     in 1969 was 'a giant step for mankind' – and also an important step for a man.
    </p>
    <p>
     But attitudes have moved on and leading engineers at NASA have said that the first person to
     <strong>
      set foot
     </strong>
     on
     <strong>
      Mars
     </strong>
     should be a woman. The space agency aims to have a
     <strong>
      gender-balanced
     </strong>
     workforce but can only achieve that if equal numbers of men and women train for science and technology careers. As Allison McIntryre, Chief of the
     <strong>
      NASA Space Vehicle Mock-up Facility
     </strong>
     , told the BBC: "My director is a women, my former division chief is a woman. We have female astronauts. We haven't put a woman on the Moon yet. And I think that perhaps the first person to step on Mars should be a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
     A woman landing on Mars would be an incredible achievement for being a first for womankind and would, for some, be
     <strong>
      out of this world
     </strong>
     ! It would certainly inspire a younger female generation by showing what is possible. For them, the thought of other
     <strong>
      planets
     </strong>
     being a men-only destination, would be
     <strong>
      an alien concept
     </strong>
     .
