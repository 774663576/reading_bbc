     从古老的洞穴绘画到现代的舞蹈、编织，再到邮票收藏，兴趣爱好一直是人类生活的一部分。有些喜欢做手工的人从自己的兴趣爱好中找到了商机，把爱好变成了生意。还有人喜欢通过扔斧头之类的休闲运动来解压。在新的一年里，你打算培养什么新的兴趣爱好？

     It's the end of one year and the start of another. You've probably been considering New Year's
     <strong>
      resolutions
     </strong>
     and you may have decided to
     <strong>
      take up
     </strong>
     something new for the year ahead. Perhaps, like Debbie Gustig, you could start
     <strong>
      ballet
     </strong>
     classes. At the age of 53, Debbie stepped into the dance studio, where, for a while, it feels like 'the outside world is on pause'.

     Hobbies are a way for us to keep busy and
     <strong>
      take our minds off
     </strong>
     the realities of work and life. People crave time to
     <strong>
      pursue
     </strong>
     interests that are valuable and satisfying. Humans have
     <strong>
      indulged in
     </strong>
     <strong>
      pastimes
     </strong>
     since the beginning of time, from drawing on cave walls to playing video games. Some hobbies involve
     <strong>
      collecting
     </strong>
     things. That means
     <strong>
      acquiring
     </strong>
     , possibly
     <strong>
      cataloguing
     </strong>
     , and then
     <strong>
      displaying
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      storing
     </strong>
     something precious, whether that be stamps, antiques or comic books.
    </p>

     Linda de Ruiter turned her hobby into a job. She is a
     <strong>
      yarn maker
     </strong>
     and now the owner of a small business. After helping out a friend with a
     <strong>
      stand
     </strong>
     at a craft market, she realised she wanted a stand for herself. She told the BBC she always thought yarn making would just be '
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      glorified
     </strong>
     <strong>
      hobby
     </strong>
     ' for her, but she's glad to have been proven wrong and says she is "
     <strong>
      having a ball
     </strong>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     People often pursue hobbies as a way of
     <strong>
      de-stressing
     </strong>
     . In Canada,
     <strong>
      axe throwing
     </strong>
     is on the rise. In fact, there is even an axe-throwing league with branches across the country and more than 1,500 members. League founder Matt Wilson told the BBC that it's "a
     <strong>
      zen
     </strong>
     sort of experience because it's really not about power, but there is definitely something
     <strong>
      cathartic
     </strong>
     about the activity".

    <p>
     So, ballet, collecting stamps, yarn making, axe throwing? What will you pursue in the new year?
