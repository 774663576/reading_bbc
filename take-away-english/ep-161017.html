     当我们听到有趣的笑话时定会忍俊不禁。然而，这并不是最常见的“发笑因素”，最能引人开怀大笑的究竟是什么呢？答案其实很简单：与人共处。研究显示，和他人在一起时发笑的频率是独处时的三十倍，而且人类并不是唯一能被逗乐的物种。

     What makes you laugh the most?
    </p>
    <p>
     While
     <strong>
      rib-tickling
     </strong>
     jokes and
     <strong>
      hilarious
     </strong>
     videos certainly do make us
     <strong>
      giggle
     </strong>
     , most of the time we laugh because of something much simpler: being with other people.
    </p>
    <p>
     So much so that we are 30 times more likely to laugh when we're with others, according to a study by
     <strong>
      neuroscientist
     </strong>
     Robert Provine from the University of Maryland. "When you're alone, laughter basically disappears," he told Smithsonian Magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what is it about other people that makes us
     <strong>
      split our sides
     </strong>
     ? The answer lies deep within our brains, and in how we form communities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Laughter is a social emotion that we use to "make and maintain
     <strong>
      social bonds
     </strong>
     ," says Professor Sophie Smith from University College London in an article for the BBC. It reassures people that situations are
     <strong>
      non-threatening
     </strong>
     . Those who laugh frequently are also often more popular. Even in a normal conversation we laugh seven times every 10 minutes, she says.
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Smith also explains that laughter is very different to speech. It is
     <strong>
      non-verbal
     </strong>
     : the
     <strong>
      wheezing
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      snorting
     </strong>
     sounds are produced by air being pushed out quickly at high pressure, without involving the teeth or lips. These sounds are the kind we make when in a state of
     <strong>
      heightened
     </strong>
     <strong>
      emotion
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     In this respect, laughter sounds more like an animal call than human language. This theory is
     <strong>
      backed up
     </strong>
     by tests which show the part of the brain responsible for laughter is not the
     <strong>
      neocortex
     </strong>
     used in language, but an 'older' area we share with mammals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, chimpanzees, gorillas and even rats all enjoy a good
     <strong>
      chortle
     </strong>
     , especially when being tickled. Just be careful when you tickle a gorilla, or you might end up
     <strong>
      laughing on the other side of your face
     </strong>
     … (Did you laugh at that
     <strong>
      gag
     </strong>
     ? Or did it just make you
     <strong>
      groan
     </strong>
     ?)

    <p>
     1. Why do we laugh so much when we're with others?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      We laugh because it helps us make and maintain social connections, it helps us understand situations are non-threatening, and because it can make us more popular.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. How is laughing unlike speaking?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Laughter is produced in a different way physically: by forcing air out quickly, without using the teeth or lips. The sounds made are similar to those we make when highly emotional, not to words. Laughing is similar to animal noises – and uses a different part of the brain to speech.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. If I tell a bad joke does it make you split your sides or groan?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      If you hear a bad joke you groan, which means to laugh awkwardly or in a forced way.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. How do you make a rat laugh?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      You tickle a rat to make it laugh.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. True or false?
     <em>
      The part of the brain responsible for speaking is newer than the part used for laughing.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      True. The part of the brain used for laughing is an older part we share with other mammals.
