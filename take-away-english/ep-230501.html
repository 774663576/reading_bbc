     Buying shampoo can be overwhelming – there are so many
     <strong>
      brands
     </strong>
     to choose from, across a huge
     <strong>
      range of
     </strong>
     prices. Some brands promise to
     <strong>
      repair
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      nourish
     </strong>
     our hair, while others promise to
     <strong>
      strengthen
     </strong>
     and add
     <strong>
      volume
     </strong>
     . But are any of these claims true? Do we even need shampoo at all?
    </p>
    <p>
     Since long before shampoo was invented – some say in India – our bodies have been producing
     <strong>
      sebum
     </strong>
     – an
     <strong>
      oil-like
     </strong>
     <strong>
      substance
     </strong>
     . Sebum stops our skin from getting dry, manages the health of our
     <strong>
      scalp
     </strong>
     and makes our hair
     <strong>
      shiny
     </strong>
     . But it also collects dirt, and, if left untouched for too long, sebum can cause our hair to become
     <strong>
      greasy
     </strong>
     . There are no disadvantages from a health perspective to letting our hair be greasy, says Eleanore Richardson, Trichologist at Fulham Scalp and Hair Clinic, but many people choose to wash their hair regularly for
     <strong>
      aesthetic
     </strong>
     reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so we reach for the shampoo bottle. Shampoos contain a group of
     <strong>
      chemicals
     </strong>
     called
     <strong>
      surfactants
     </strong>
     . They grab the dirt and grease from the
     <strong>
      surface
     </strong>
     of our hair, meaning when we
     <strong>
      rinse
     </strong>
     away the shampoo, we also wash away the grease and dirt. But, as Laura Waters, who's a Professor of Pharmaceutical Analysis in the School of Applied Sciences at Huddersfield University, points out, 'some surfactants work too well' and take the natural oils out of the hair, as well. More expensive shampoos may contain less
     <strong>
      harsh
     </strong>
     surfactants, but – adds Laura Waters – the type of shampoo doesn't really matter. 'It's on our hair very briefly and gets washed away'. It's the
     <strong>
      conditioners
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      styling products
     </strong>
     that we use after the shampoo that make a bigger difference to the
     <strong>
      texture
     </strong>
     and feel of our hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, the more we put onto our hair, the more we need to
     <strong>
      cleanse
     </strong>
     it off, creating a vicious circle. So, yes, it seems we do have a need for shampoo, but we also shouldn't expect it to be a
     <strong>
      miracle cure
     </strong>
     . And, finally, next time you're in a shampoo aisle, remember that hair is made up of dead protein cells and that, sadly, not even the most expensive shampoo can bring them back to life.

    <p>
     1. What is sebum?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Sebum is an oil-like substance that our bodies make to maintain healthy skin and hair.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Is it unhealthy if our hair is greasy?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      No. Many people choose to wash their hair regularly for aesthetic reasons, but greasy hair is not connected to health.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. True or False?
     <em>
      Some surfactants clean the hair too much.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      True. Some surfactants take the natural oils out of the hair, as well as the dirt and grease they're intended to remove.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. What difference can buying a more expensive shampoo make?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      More expensive shampoos may contain less harsh surfactants.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Which affects our hair more – shampoo, or conditioners and styling products?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Conditioners and styling products can affect the texture and feel of our hair, but shampoo is on our hair too briefly to really matter.
