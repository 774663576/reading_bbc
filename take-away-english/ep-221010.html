      词汇：laughter 笑声

     What things make you laugh? There are many things that make us
     <strong>
      chuckle
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      burst into laughter
     </strong>
     . This natural show of emotion gives off signals that we are happy, we find something
     <strong>
      humorous
     </strong>
     or even that we’re just
     <strong>
      a barrel of laughs
     </strong>
     !
     <strong>
      Gelotologists
     </strong>
     have been looking at why we do it and what the benefits are.
    </p>
    <p>
     Laughter is a very
     <strong>
      primitive
     </strong>
     way of making a sound. When we do it, we make very strange noises – from
     <strong>
      wheezes
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      squeaks
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      gasps
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      snorts
     </strong>
     – and each sound simply reflects the muscles in the chest squeezing out air from our ribcages under very high pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most of the time our laughter is
     <strong>
      involuntary
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      contagious
     </strong>
     , particularly between friends. Neuroscientist, Sophie Scott, told the BBC that it’s “a social emotion. It’s better to laugh with people we like.” She defines two types of laughter –
     <strong>
      spontaneous
     </strong>
     <strong>
      laughter
     </strong>
     , where we laugh instantly and uncontrollably, and
     <strong>
      conversational laughter
     </strong>
     – where we laugh together with friends. Research found, on average, people laugh seven times for every ten minutes of conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     The BBC World Service programme Crowd Science examined the science of laughter. It wanted to know what caused this highly
     <strong>
      infectious
     </strong>
     repetitive action. It found we use laughter to show others that we’re being playful and
     <strong>
      non-threatening
     </strong>
     , and this serves to make and maintain
     <strong>
      social bonds
     </strong>
     . Also, people outside of our social group can understand the relationship between the laughers by the sound of our chuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
     While our health is
     <strong>
      no laughing matter
     </strong>
     , research has found a good
     <strong>
      guffaw
     </strong>
     can help our body and mind – it can make us feel good and relax our bodies. It also helps us manage pain and improve our immune system. That’s why
     <strong>
      laughter therapy
     </strong>
     is being used as an alternative to conventional treatments. But generally, our ability to laugh is out of our control. When you start doing it, just go with the flow and others will join in.
