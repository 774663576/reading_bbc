       Poverty 贫穷

     </em>
    </h3>
    <p>
     When looking at Western Europe, we don't usually think about poverty - but in fact, some people in modern-day Britain are so
     <strong>
      hard up
     </strong>
     that they can't
     <strong>
      afford
     </strong>
     to buy food.
    </p>
    <p>
     Back in 2008, the
     <strong>
      financial crisis
     </strong>
     caused a lot of
     <strong>
      redundancies
     </strong>
     . Then there were the cuts to the
     <strong>
      welfare system
     </strong>
     in 2013 which added to the problem - and many British people
     <strong>
      fell into debt
     </strong>
     . It's estimated that 500,000 people in the UK have turned to
     <strong>
      food banks
     </strong>
     , just
     <strong>
      to get by
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Steph Hagen, who works in a Nottingham food bank, says: "People do not go to a food bank because it's an open door. It's a case of they go to it because they need to. With our food bank - we are an independent one, and we have
     <strong>
      limited stocks
     </strong>
     - everyone who comes through our door has no income whatsoever."
    </p>
    <p>
     There are checks and
     <strong>
      referrals
     </strong>
     to make sure nobody is
     <strong>
      abusing the system
     </strong>
     . If a doctor or a social worker thinks someone needs to use a food bank - even for a short time - they can give them
     <strong>
      vouchers
     </strong>
     . Then the people in need take the vouchers along to the food bank and they get
     <strong>
      handouts
     </strong>
     for three days.
    </p>
    <p>
     Churches and individual
     <strong>
      donors
     </strong>
     provide most of the food in the banks. But some businesses might help out too.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what sort of food is offered in food banks? Hagen says: "Basically, we've got porridge. We do occasionally get fresh produce but it's very rare, especially in the winter months. It's like, tinned fruit, tinned
     <strong>
      ready meals
     </strong>
     . We have to give out 'no-cooking' food parcels because people can't afford the gas and electricity".
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Community spirit
     </strong>
     has a lot to do with food banks.
     <strong>
      Volunteers
     </strong>
     say they are a great meeting place for people who are lonely and depressed. And when facing a crisis, some
     <strong>
      beneficiaries
     </strong>
     might need to feed not only their belly - but also their soul.

    <p>
     2. How do food banks make sure people are genuinely in need?

     4. Why do food banks mostly offer people tinned food?
