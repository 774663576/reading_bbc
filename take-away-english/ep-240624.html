     时间旅行在理论上是可以实现的。爱因斯坦创立的相对论将空间和时间联系在了一起，相对论提出，如果你以接近光速的速度从地球向太空飞去，那么在返回地球时，你将可以到达 “未来”。然而，要想 “穿越” 到过去则困难得多，不过理论上是有一种方法可以帮人类实现这个愿望，即通过 “蠕虫洞” 穿越时空，但目前尚无证据表明蠕虫洞确实存在。本文探讨时间旅行的可能性。

     If you could time travel, would you visit the past or the future? You could find your
     <strong>
      ancestors
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      descendants
     </strong>
     , or experience life when dinosaurs roamed your back garden. It sounds
     <strong>
      otherworldly
     </strong>
     , but scientists have looked into whether time travel is actually possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Albert Einstein's
     <strong>
      theory of relativity
     </strong>
     revolutionised understanding of space, time,
     <strong>
      mass
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      gravity
     </strong>
     . The key element of this theory is that time and space are linked together, and time doesn't
     <strong>
      flow
     </strong>
     at a constant rate, meaning it
     <strong>
      speeds up
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      slows down
     </strong>
     , depending on where you are. For example, when you travel at high speeds, time decreases, which means, according to NASA, astronauts in space
     <strong>
      age
     </strong>
     more slowly than those on Earth! So, if you wanted to travel to the future, you would need to move close to
     <strong>
      the speed of light
     </strong>
     . Then, while
     <strong>
      centuries
     </strong>
     pass on Earth, you'd experience a relatively short amount of time and could hypothetically return home, where it would be the future!
    </p>
    <p>
     Travelling backwards in time seems much more difficult. Theoretically, one way of going back is via a
     <strong>
      wormhole
     </strong>
     . That means, if space and time can be folded like paper, we could create a tunnel – a
     <strong>
      shortcut
     </strong>
     between points in time. The problem is that there is no evidence that wormholes exist. "It's been shown mathematically that they can exist, but whether they exist physically is something else," says Emma Osborne, an
     <strong>
      astrophysicist
     </strong>
     at the University of York. Also, theories show that wormholes would be so small that a person definitely couldn't fit through one, and they would have such an intense
     <strong>
      gravitational
     </strong>
     <strong>
      field
     </strong>
     that they would
     <strong>
      collapse
     </strong>
     very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     For now, it seems we'll have to be content with
     <strong>
      science fiction
     </strong>
     and using
     <strong>
      telescopes
     </strong>
     to look back in time rather than travelling through it.

      Time doesn't flow at a constant rate, meaning it speeds up or slows down, depending on where you are.
