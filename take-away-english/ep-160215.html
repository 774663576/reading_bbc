     "I have nothing to wear!" You might have said to yourself, feeling slightly distressed, wardrobe door wide open, hours before going to a party or important event.
     <strong>
      Casual
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      formal
     </strong>
     ? Is this too
     <strong>
      flamboyant
     </strong>
     ? Should I look more
     <strong>
      demure
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     How strictly should we follow fashion rules?  'Never mix
     <strong>
      patterns
     </strong>
     ' is one of them. Clashing
     <strong>
      prints
     </strong>
     might make Coco Chanel
     <strong>
      spin in her grave
     </strong>
     but gets
     <strong>
      the seal of approval
     </strong>
     of some stylists nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's
     <strong>
      edgy
     </strong>
     ," says Martine Alexander, adviser to British TV actresses. "Matching everything makes you look like you've tried too hard. Style should look
     <strong>
      effortless
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, just be careful not to make people's eyes
     <strong>
      go funny
     </strong>
     when they look at you, I say.
    </p>
    <p>
     Men have the issue of white socks. "Unless you're exercising there is absolutely no appropriate moment to wear white socks," says Alex Bilmes, editor of the men's magazine Esquire. And he adds: "These types of rules exist to make sure fashion innocents don't make such a bad mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
     We all know that white socks are usually
     <strong>
      bulky
     </strong>
     and may look cheap. But there's a long British tradition of men wearing socks with sandals so… Maybe critics should
     <strong>
      put a sock in it
     </strong>
     and let us wear what we are comfortable with.
    </p>
    <p>
     When you look a particular way you are sending a message about yourself. It's not a good idea to go to a job interview wearing shorts or showing too much
     <strong>
      cleavage
     </strong>
     . Or going to the market in your
     <strong>
      pyjamas
     </strong>
     . But, whatever you wear, do it with confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Designer Gianni Versace said it all: "Don't be into
     <strong>
      trends
     </strong>
     . Don't make fashion own you, but you decide what you are, and what you want to express, by the way you dress and the way you live."
