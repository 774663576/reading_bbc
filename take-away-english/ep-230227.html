     虽然辛辣食物会刺激口内黏膜，让人舌头发麻、嘴巴冒火，浑身冒汗，但很多人认为吃辣是 “痛并快乐的”，甚至 “无辣不欢”。辣椒是世界各地许多菜肴中的关键成分。本期节目从科学和历史两方面分析人们热衷吃辣的原因。

      词汇：sensation 感受
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     You know the feeling – your ears start to warm up, your tongue
     <strong>
      goes numb
     </strong>
     , you start sweating and taking deep breaths. You've just eaten something spicy knowing it would be painful, and, yet, you chose to do it anyway. Are humans just
     <strong>
      masochistic
     </strong>
     , or is there something else going on? The answer lies in both science and history.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's start with the science. Spicy isn't actually a
     <strong>
      taste
     </strong>
     like salty, sweet,
     <strong>
      sour
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      bitter
     </strong>
     – it’s a
     <strong>
      sensation
     </strong>
     . This sensation is
     <strong>
      triggered
     </strong>
     by a
     <strong>
      chemical compound
     </strong>
     found in chilli peppers called '
     <strong>
      capsaicin
     </strong>
     '. When we eat foods
     <strong>
      containing
     </strong>
     capsaicin, our bodies are
     <strong>
      tricked
     </strong>
     into thinking the temperature is actually rising. In trying to
     <strong>
      temper
     </strong>
     the burning sensation, our bodies
     <strong>
      release
     </strong>
     <strong>
      endorphins
     </strong>
     which control pain and, at the same time, give a feeling of pleasure – like painkillers.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is what is happening chemically, but there is also a
     <strong>
      conscious
     </strong>
     side to choosing spicy food. Dr Tamara Rosenbaum, Cognitive Neuroscientist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, explains in an interview with the BBC that this is because we are
     <strong>
      rational
     </strong>
     <strong>
      beings
     </strong>
     – we know that the burning sensation of chilli does not physically harm us. Furthermore, we
     <strong>
      derive
     </strong>
     pleasure from the other ingredients chilli is generally cooked and eaten with – including fat, sugar and salt. So – like skydiving – eating chilli is a form of
     <strong>
      thrill-seeking
     </strong>
     or '
     <strong>
      benign
     </strong>
     <strong>
      masochism
     </strong>
     ', where we get pleasure from a seemingly negative sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     This masochistic relationship with capsaicin has been a long one, starting in the Andes of South America, where chilli peppers originate. Humans were one of the few mammals on Earth that
     <strong>
      developed
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a taste for
     </strong>
     capsaicin so, archaeological evidence suggests, they started
     <strong>
      cultivating
     </strong>
     chilli peppers about six thousand years ago. Human
     <strong>
      intervention
     </strong>
     changed the chilli pepper to suit human tastes and needs – including the pepper's colour, size and capsaicin
     <strong>
      content
     </strong>
     – helping to explain the many different types of chilli peppers now available.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fast-forward to today, and our love affair with the chilli pepper is
     <strong>
      going strong
     </strong>
     . We eat around 57.3 million tons of peppers globally each year, and chilli is a key ingredient in traditional dishes from Mexico to Korea. Maybe we are masochistic after all.
