     如今，有很多人选择不吃肉。实验室培育肉已经被讨论了多年，但为什么我们直至今日仍然不能在超市或餐馆买到这种肉呢？这是因为生产这种肉的成本非常高，主要原因是在实验室环境下培育这种肉的细胞需要大量的原材料。此外，还有哪些原因使实验室培育肉仍未能出现在大家的饭桌上？本文围绕这一话题展开讨论。

     Imagine a future where we can
     <strong>
      tuck into
     </strong>
     meat, but no animals have been sacrificed in the process. 16% of the UK population enjoy a
     <strong>
      meat-free diet
     </strong>
     , according to statistics website Finder.com. It seems there is an appeal in
     <strong>
      lab-grown
     </strong>
     meat as an alternative to
     <strong>
      traditional
     </strong>
     meat
     <strong>
      consumption
     </strong>
     . But, despite years of anticipation, this futuristic food is still not on our
     <strong>
      plates
     </strong>
     . Why?
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the biggest reasons is cost. The first ever lab-grown
     <strong>
      hamburger
     </strong>
     was unveiled in 2013 by Dutch scientist Mark Post. It was created from
     <strong>
      beef
     </strong>
     <strong>
      cells
     </strong>
     and cost more than $300,000. Lab-grown meat
     <strong>
      production
     </strong>
     stretches from thousands to hundreds of thousands of US dollars per
     <strong>
      ounce
     </strong>
     – that's the weight of about two
     <strong>
      chicken nuggets
     </strong>
     . This expense is partly due to the cost of
     <strong>
      raw
     </strong>
     <strong>
      materials
     </strong>
     that '
     <strong>
      feed
     </strong>
     ' the cells – a combination of sugar, proteins and other nutrients are added to the cells.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 2023, US-based company Upside Foods received approval from the US Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration to start selling lab-grown meat. In order to do this, the company has had to take on significant economic losses so that they can price it fairly compared to traditional meat. An investor in Upside Food, Lisa Feria, told Forbes magazine "Profitability is very much years off because the biggest challenge ahead of them is can we make it at millions of tons a year and ultimately remotely compete with
     <strong>
      conventional
     </strong>
     meat".
    </p>
    <p>
     There are also environmental costs. A 2023 study by the University of California found that the process of producing lab-grown meat could have a four to 25 times higher impact on global warming than beef, which is generally the
     <strong>
      highest-polluting
     </strong>
     meat. This is mostly because of the emissions needed to create 'feed'.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, it seems unlikely that we'll be eating lab-grown meat just yet, and we possibly never will.
