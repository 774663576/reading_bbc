     Sometimes our friends'
     <strong>
      behaviour
     </strong>
     can
     <strong>
      offend
     </strong>
     us; sometimes we can see changes they need to make – but how do we tell them? Are there any ways to make difficult conversations easier?
    </p>
    <p>
     It's important to have solid evidence that there is indeed a
     <strong>
      problem
     </strong>
     . Evidence that can be agreed upon makes it easier for other people to recognise
     <strong>
      issues
     </strong>
     . Once you have proof, it's important to highlight how it
     <strong>
      impacts
     </strong>
     us and others. Psychologist Andrea Bonior suggests
     <strong>
      framing
     </strong>
     problems with 'I'. Saying 'I feel hurt that you spend less time with me' is less
     <strong>
      accusatory
     </strong>
     than 'You never spend time with me!' and is focused more clearly on the impact.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staying
     <strong>
      calm
     </strong>
     is vital. Becoming tense might lead you to
     <strong>
      react
     </strong>
     badly and cause an
     <strong>
      argument
     </strong>
     . Bonior recommends that you should acknowledge the conversation could make you
     <strong>
      anxious
     </strong>
     . If you think about this yourself, it can help you focus on positive results. If you admit your
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     to your friend, you will show a more human side. Another psychologist, Laura Brennan, points out how it's important that we let go of our
     <strong>
      ego
     </strong>
     and don't focus on the need to be proved right. This can help reduce tension.
    </p>
    <p>
     We can lower the potential for
     <strong>
      conflict
     </strong>
     by listening to the other person and asking questions. Many experts recommend planning your words, so that you can say things in a way that avoids conflict. However, Bonior cautions against
     <strong>
      overplanning
     </strong>
     as this can stop you being flexible enough to genuinely follow and participate in the
     <strong>
      discussion
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Be realistic. Complicated problems are unlikely to be solved with one conversation. Consider what is possible in one discussion, and that it may be harder than you initially thought. This will help you to set realistic goals for what you can achieve.
