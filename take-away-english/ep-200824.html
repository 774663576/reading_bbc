     For many of us, there’s nothing better than burying our head in a good book. Whether it’s a
     <strong>
      gripping
     </strong>
     <strong>
      crime story
     </strong>
     or a
     <strong>
      biography
     </strong>
     of someone’s amazing life, it’s good to read a book to switch off from the distractions of everyday life and help us relax. Maybe that’s why some of them are actually being prescribed as a remedy to sickness.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may seem obvious that reading is good for us. It can be
     <strong>
      educational
     </strong>
     , and, as some say, it can ‘
     <strong>
      broaden the mind
     </strong>
     ’. A good
     <strong>
      novel
     </strong>
     can make us happy or sad, or make us cry as we empathise with
     <strong>
      characters
     </strong>
     . The power of books was recognised a few years ago by the British charity Reading Agency, who published a list of books that doctors could offer to patients, tackling topics from depression to dementia to chronic pain. It called this ‘
     <strong>
      bibliotherapy
     </strong>
     ’ and it’s become so successful that it's about to be extended to children as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Philip Davis studies the effects of
     <strong>
      literature
     </strong>
     at Liverpool University and is author of a book called Reading for Life. He studies people in reading groups and found that it’s reading literature – written work thought to have
     <strong>
      artistic merit
     </strong>
     , that has the best effect. He told the BBC that when reading something for pleasure, “…the brain begins to work from different parts, from a different hemisphere and it gets excited, it gets pre-emotional – and you can see the brain coming to life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, it’s easy in our smartphone generation to
     <strong>
      ditch
     </strong>
     a good book and fiddle with our phones instead. But opening up a
     <strong>
      paperback
     </strong>
     could be a simple way to help boost or maintain our
     <strong>
      mental health
     </strong>
     . It's thought they can help you set targets and find focus. And they may allow you to see that awkward situation you've been anxious about for weeks from someone else's
     <strong>
      perspective
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     If you’re not an
     <strong>
      avid reader
     </strong>
     it can be hard to know where to begin. If the Reading Agency book list doesn’t appeal, you could to read
     <strong>
      book
     </strong>
     <strong>
      reviews
     </strong>
     , visit a
     <strong>
      library
     </strong>
     or bookshop or ask a friend. Once you’ve found the right
     <strong>
      text
     </strong>
     , you’ll be
     <strong>
      hooked
     </strong>
     ! And if you still love your technology, you could always use an
     <strong>
      e-reader
     </strong>
     .
