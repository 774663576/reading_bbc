     一项由英国政府委托调研的报告结果显示，如果人们再不行动起来对抗“超级病菌”的话，那么到 2050 年，平均每三秒钟，超级病菌就会夺走一个人的生命。英国医生建议人们减少抗生素的使用。本期内容讨论人类对越来越多的细菌产生抗药性的担忧。

    </p>
    <p>
     If you live in England and have a mild
     <strong>
      infection
     </strong>
     , don't ask your
     <strong>
      GP
     </strong>
     to recommend
     <strong>
      antibiotics
     </strong>
     . He'll probably say 'no' and give you something else. This is part of an initiative to put a stop to harmful infections becoming resistant to these drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Recent figures from the
     <strong>
      NHS
     </strong>
     have shown that the number of
     <strong>
      prescriptions
     </strong>
     for all types of antibiotics were down by 7.3% on the previous year to about 34 million in 2015 and 2016, which is considered a success by the authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Peter Taylor, Professor of
     <strong>
      Microbiology
     </strong>
     , UCL School of
     <strong>
      Pharmacy
     </strong>
     , says that antibiotics are probably "the safest and most effective drugs ever produced, but they have an
     <strong>
      Achilles heel
     </strong>
     - every time we use an antibiotic it alters the levels of bacteria out there in the environment and engenders resistance in a way that is very similar to
     <strong>
      Darwinian natural selection
     </strong>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     The power of these substances was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928 almost by chance. The Scottish
     <strong>
      bacteriologist
     </strong>
     returned to his laboratory after a holiday to find a bacteria-free circle around a growth of
     <strong>
      mould
     </strong>
     on a
     <strong>
      Petri dish
     </strong>
     . It gave us our first antibiotic:
     <strong>
      penicillin
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The availability of these drugs revolutionised the treatment of infections. In the past
     <strong>
      STIs
     </strong>
     spread by bacteria were often
     <strong>
      incurable
     </strong>
     and deadly. Today all it takes to treat them is a trip to the clinic and a course of antibiotics. Childbirth was very dangerous and routinely ended in death for both mother and baby. Now the risk of a woman dying in England and Wales during
     <strong>
      labour
     </strong>
     is between 40 and 50 times lower than 60 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bacteria will continue to evolve to seek survival and we have to up our game. There hasn't been a new class of antibiotics since the 1980s and
     <strong>
      pharmaceutical
     </strong>
     companies are looking into a wide-range of alternatives – from compound from insects to
     <strong>
      nanotechnology
     </strong>
     - to develop new weapons in the continuous war against
     <strong>
      superbugs
     </strong>
     .
