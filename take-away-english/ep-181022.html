     智能手机的普及和社交媒体平台的出现让人们更加方便地拍摄并分享自己生活中的点点滴滴。如今，还有人会去购买传统的照相机吗？新技术的发明是否意味着传统摄影将被推出历史舞台？本集《随身英语》探讨这一话题，并介绍和 “摄影” 有关的英语词汇。

     <strong>
      Vocabulary: photography 词汇: 摄影
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     We all love to take photographs. It's a simple way to
     <strong>
      capture
     </strong>
     a special moment, an amazing view, or just to show off your artistic skills. And it's great to look back through your photo
     <strong>
      albums
     </strong>
     and share your memories with friends. In essence, they show a
     <strong>
      snapshot
     </strong>
     in time. This hasn't really changed since the invention of photography in the 1830s. But one thing that has changed, is the equipment we use.
    </p>
    <p>
     For many years, we have used traditional cameras to take our
     <strong>
      pictures
     </strong>
     with. Our images were captured onto camera film which was then
     <strong>
      processed
     </strong>
     into
     <strong>
      negatives
     </strong>
     from which photos were printed – a lengthy process. And we've have had a range of cameras to choose from – from the simple
     <strong>
      compact camera
     </strong>
     to more sophisticated single lens reflex, or
     <strong>
      SLR cameras
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But the biggest change has come with the development of digital technology. This has made taking photos quicker and easier. It's enabled us to take a
     <strong>
      snap
     </strong>
     and review our pictures instantly. We've been able to
     <strong>
      manipulate
     </strong>
     them in
     <strong>
      post-production
     </strong>
     , using software on our computer. And of course, we've been able to share them like never before – particularly on social media.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, now we have the
     <strong>
      smartphone
     </strong>
     – a phone that is, well, smart because it can take photos and sometimes very good quality ones, and we can share them easily. So does that mean the traditional camera will eventually become obsolete? Figures from Japan show how the market is shrinking: shipments of compact digital cameras from companies like Olympus, Canon and Nikon were down 39% year on year.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Phil Hall, editor of Tech Radar magazine thinks there's nothing to worry about. He told the BBC that while people are swapping their compact cameras for smartphones, "manufacturers are looking at the more
     <strong>
      higher-end
     </strong>
     <strong>
      premium
     </strong>
     cameras, high-end compacts,
     <strong>
      DSLR
     </strong>
     s, which are the ones you can attach
     <strong>
      lenses
     </strong>
     to, mirrorless cameras."
    </p>
    <p>
     Certainly, the growth of the smartphone means more and more of us are taking photos and it opens our eyes to the
     <strong>
      creative
     </strong>
     possibilities it can provide. And for some, it can be a first step into getting into serious photography and pushing their creative skills. But whatever camera
     <strong>
      viewfinder
     </strong>
     we end up looking through, it's important to remember the basics of focussing, good lighting and
     <strong>
      framing
     </strong>
     - and getting your subject to
     <strong>
      say 'cheese!'
     </strong>
