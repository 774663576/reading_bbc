     Are you
     <strong>
      a dog person
     </strong>
     ? Maybe you have one at home and enjoy taking it for walks and curling up with it on the sofa.  Personally, I'm not that kind of person – for me they're
     <strong>
      aggressive
     </strong>
     , smelly animals that need constant care and lack the independent nature and intelligence that cats have. But given the
     <strong>
      life-saving
     </strong>
     skills that some dogs possess, maybe I should
     <strong>
      give them a second chance
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     To some a perfect
     <strong>
      pooch
     </strong>
     might be one that looks cute, is
     <strong>
      loyal
     </strong>
     and sits when it's told but that's about it – it's just a pet. But to really be
     <strong>
      man's best friend
     </strong>
     , they need to do something useful. Some breeds that have amazing
     <strong>
      sense of smell
     </strong>
     are put to good use as
     <strong>
      sniffer dogs
     </strong>
     or detection dogs, and are trained to use their senses to detect
     <strong>
      substances
     </strong>
     such as explosives and illegal drugs. You'll often see them at airports or working with police out on the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other types of working dogs include
     <strong>
      guide dogs
     </strong>
     , hearing dogs and mobility dogs all providing a life-saving service to their owners. Some dogs can alert emergency services when their owner has a
     <strong>
      seizure
     </strong>
     .  And there are clever
     <strong>
      canines
     </strong>
     that have been trained to provide
     <strong>
      affection
     </strong>
     and comfort to people in hospitals, retirement homes or schools and to people with
     <strong>
      autism
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     New uses for dogs are being discovered all the time. Dr Claire Guest is CEO of Medical Detection Dogs, she says "although the dog has a fluffy coat and a
     <strong>
      waggy
     </strong>
     tail, he is in fact a highly sophisticated
     <strong>
      bio-sensor
     </strong>
     . You know, evolution has given him this highly sensitive nose, going down to parts per trillion."
    </p>
    <p>
     It's this incredible ability that has led to the UK's National Health Service assessing whether dogs can be used to detect early stage
     <strong>
      prostate cancer
     </strong>
     - vital for improving survival rates.
    </p>
    <p>
     The dogs - usually from the gundog breed, such as labradors and springer spaniels - are taught to detect a sample of urine from a patient with prostate cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's also managed to train dogs to detect changes in blood glucose levels in people suffering from
     <strong>
      type 1 diabetes
     </strong>
     . One patient, who has one of these
     <strong>
      medical alert assistance dogs
     </strong>
     , told the BBC that "in the three and a half years we've been together, he has alerted and potentially saved my life 3,500 times. And he does it all for a dog biscuit."
    </p>
    <p>
     To save a life for a dog biscuit seems
     <strong>
      a small price to pay
     </strong>
     so maybe I should have more admiration and respect for our
     <strong>
      four-legged friends
     </strong>
     – maybe cats aren't so smart!
