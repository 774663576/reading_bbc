     How do you relax after a stressful day in the office? There are many
     <strong>
      remedies
     </strong>
     to help you
     <strong>
      unwind
     </strong>
     , but the best solution, according to some experts, lies in the great outdoors. It takes a little effort to get there but the benefits can be a perfect
     <strong>
      tonic
     </strong>
     for our stressed out lives. I am talking about the activity of forest bathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Japanese concept of shinrin-yoku – or forest bathing – originates from the 1980s, when it was introduced as a national health programme by the country’s government. Stressed Japanese workers are today still relaxing and
     <strong>
      reconnecting
     </strong>
     with nature. The Forest Therapy Society has certified 62 forest
     <strong>
      therapy
     </strong>
     sites in the country and the forest bathing movement is also
     <strong>
      gathering momentum
     </strong>
     in other parts of the world. It says: "Just as bathing in a hot spring helps to soak your cares away, going for a walk in the woods is said to have a
     <strong>
      soothing effect
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     If you’re worried that bathing involves stripping off your clothes, don’t be! This is about taking time to wander through woodland with no fixed plan or route and just immerse yourself in the forest atmosphere. Some health experts have said that having this
     <strong>
      exposure
     </strong>
     to nature seems to promote
     <strong>
      well-being
     </strong>
     and that’s particularly good for people with
     <strong>
      mental health
     </strong>
     issues. A study conducted in 24 forests across Japan found that walking among trees lowered
     <strong>
      blood pressure
     </strong>
     , the
     <strong>
      pulse rate
     </strong>
     , and the levels of the
     <strong>
      hormone
     </strong>
     cortisol, which is released in response to stress. It also found
     <strong>
      phytoncides
     </strong>
     -
     <strong>
      chemicals
     </strong>
     emitted by trees - have an anti-microbial effect on humans, boosting our
     <strong>
      immune systems
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Another study carried out a few years ago by Stanford University in the US, found similar benefits. Brain scans showed reduced activity in an area of the brain linked to the risk of mental illness in participants who took a 90-minute walk among oaks, birds and squirrels. One of the researchers, Gregory Bratman, told the BBC: "There's an increasing
     <strong>
      body of evidence
     </strong>
     showing that natural versus urban areas benefit us at least emotionally with our
     <strong>
      mood
     </strong>
     and possibly also our
     <strong>
      cognitive development
     </strong>
     too.”  The evidence seems clear that forest bathing is
     <strong>
      a shot in the arm
     </strong>
     for stressed out workers, so now is the time to get out and lose yourself in the natural environment – you could even hug a tree as it could be your new best friend!
