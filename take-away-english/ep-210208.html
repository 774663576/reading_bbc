     Have you got any gadgets hanging around your home that you no longer want or use? Between us, we have millions of bits of tech
     <strong>
      stockpiled
     </strong>
     in drawers that could be given
     <strong>
      a new lease of life
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Part of the problem for our unloved gadgets is that many become
     <strong>
      obsolete
     </strong>
     quickly because their software doesn’t get updated. Other items are left
     <strong>
      unused
     </strong>
     because they’re broken or they’ve become
     <strong>
      superseded
     </strong>
     by a fancy new version. Many of these items are
     <strong>
      electronics
     </strong>
     , but despite them appearing to be
     <strong>
      past their sell-by date
     </strong>
     , they don’t need to end up in
     <strong>
      landfill
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     There are several ways to make the most of our unwanted gadgets.
     <strong>
      Recycling
     </strong>
     is the obvious solution. Materials used to make them can be
     <strong>
      extracted
     </strong>
     and reused in other things. As an example, Elisabeth Ratcliffe from the Royal Society of Chemistry told the BBC: “There are about thirty different
     <strong>
      elements
     </strong>
     just in a smartphone, and many of them are very rare.” These can be used in touch screens and solar panels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Probably the best
     <strong>
      antidote
     </strong>
     to our
     <strong>
      throwaway culture
     </strong>
     is to
     <strong>
      repair
     </strong>
     our broken tech. This takes patience and skill, which can be learnt at repair clubs and repair cafés –free meeting places where you’ll find
     <strong>
      tools
     </strong>
     and materials to help you make any
     <strong>
      repairs
     </strong>
     you need. In the UK, the interest in
     <strong>
      mending
     </strong>
     our stuff and giving it a new life is reflected by the popularity of a TV series called The Repair Shop, where
     <strong>
      craftspeople
     </strong>
     rescue and
     <strong>
      resurrect
     </strong>
     items their owners thought were beyond saving.
    </p>
    <p>
     A final option for your
     <strong>
      discarded
     </strong>
     gadgets is to
     <strong>
      upcycle
     </strong>
     them. You can
     <strong>
      breathe new life
     </strong>
     <strong>
      into
     </strong>
     unwanted stuff by
     <strong>
      transforming
     </strong>
     it into valuable pieces or collectable retroitems. These could be sold on, meaning you can make some cash from your
     <strong>
      junk
     </strong>
     and create much needed space in your home!
