      Vocabulary: gifts 词汇: 礼物
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     It's that time of year when many of us spend money buying gifts for family and friends. We spend hours, even days, searching the shops and websites trying to find the right present for someone - a pair of socks, perfume, a new gadget – only to find the
     <strong>
      recipient
     </strong>
     already has it or they've been given it already. Or worse, they just don't like it, which makes me think, "Are we wasting our time and money?"
    </p>
    <p>
     There is so much stuff in the world already and so much waste that maybe when it comes to Christmas giving, we need
     <strong>
      to think outside the box
     </strong>
     – use our imagination and be more creative with our
     <strong>
      generosity
     </strong>
     . This is particularly true for children, who tend to receive mountains of toys some of which end up not even being looked at. One idea is to
     <strong>
      implement
     </strong>
     a 'one-gift' rule so that children don't grow up
     <strong>
      spoiled
     </strong>
     . Getting too many gifts can also send out the wrong message. Speaking to BBC online, clinical psychologist Linda Blair says, "When we are given a lot, we expect to receive a lot… even if it's only at Christmas and on birthdays, it will impact on children's attitudes." She also suggests, "If you want to give a gift, give your time".
    </p>
    <p>
     She makes a good point - for children and adults alike, when it comes to giving, think about offering something other than a
     <strong>
      material object
     </strong>
     that may get forgotten, discarded or
     <strong>
      re-gifted
     </strong>
     .  Buying an
     <strong>
      experience
     </strong>
     is one alternative - a chance for someone to try something out and do something different. It will cost you money, but for the recipient it could be an opportunity to try something they could not normally afford or would not have thought about doing. It would therefore be
     <strong>
      memorable
     </strong>
     and, hopefully, much
     <strong>
      appreciated
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Another
     <strong>
      practical
     </strong>
     gift could be to buy someone lessons, giving them a chance to learn new skills such as horse riding or learning English. And there are what are called '
     <strong>
      favours
     </strong>
     ' –
     <strong>
      money-can't-buy
     </strong>
     offerings to do jobs for someone like babysitting, cleaning or giving someone a massage. And there is always the
     <strong>
      fallback
     </strong>
     of giving
     <strong>
      vouchers
     </strong>
     to spend in a shop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, if you can't think of an
     <strong>
      original
     </strong>
     way to give a gift, the alternative is to not buy anything at all. You may be accused of being a '
     <strong>
      Scrooge
     </strong>
     ' but at least you're not wasting money on
     <strong>
      pointless
     </strong>
     gifts and you could give the money to charity instead – a more
     <strong>
      worthy cause
     </strong>
     . But if this year, you receive a present that's not to your liking don't be ungrateful and remember the age-old saying that '
     <strong>
      it's the thought that counts
     </strong>
     '.

    <p>

     <strong>
      According to clinical psychologist Linda Blair, when we are given a lot, we expect to receive a lot – so we get used to getting lots of gifts.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. How much does it cost to buy 'a favour'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Nothing. A favour involves you offering to do something for someone for free.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. True or false?
     <em>
      An experience is something you have to share with someone.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. An experience is something you can buy for someone but you don't necessarily have to do it with them.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Why might giving money to charity be a good idea at Christmas?
     <br/>

      It means you don't waste your money on buying pointless or unwanted gifts.
