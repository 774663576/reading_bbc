     At school you're surrounded by people your own age. Of course you spend a lot of time with them, and so some of the best friendships are
     <strong>
      forged
     </strong>
     at school. But later in life, it's easy to
     <strong>
      lose
     </strong>
     <strong>
      touch
     </strong>
     – you work full-time, maybe start a family, and your old friends might be
     <strong>
      scattered
     </strong>
     across the country or even the world. A 2016 study in Finland found that after the age of 25, the number of friends someone has falls very quickly, and this number continues to decrease throughout a person's life. So when you're in your mid-to-late 20s, how can you make new friends?
    </p>
    <p>
     Radhika Sanghani, a BBC journalist, tasked herself with making new friends by saying 'yes' to any
     <strong>
      invitations
     </strong>
     that came her way. If a colleague asked her for lunch, she didn't
     <strong>
      shy
     </strong>
     <strong>
      away
     </strong>
     from it, and she soon made some of the
     <strong>
      closest
     </strong>
     friends she'd ever had. "We all message several times a week often leaving rambling
     <strong>
      voice
     </strong>
     <strong>
      notes
     </strong>
     ; we
     <strong>
      host
     </strong>
     dinners at each other's houses; and we've all cried on each other at least once (the true mark of friendship)" she wrote in a 2018 article.

     The website Talk Twenties recommends joining a local class or group, like taking up running or joining a choir. Having something
     <strong>
      in
     </strong>
     <strong>
      common
     </strong>
     gives you something to talk about with your new
     <strong>
      acquaintances
     </strong>
     , which will hopefully then translate into
     <strong>
      meaningful
     </strong>
     relationships. When you don't have
     <strong>
      mutual
     </strong>
     interests with someone, it can be difficult to get past the
     <strong>
      small
     </strong>
     <strong>
      talk
     </strong>
     stage, where conversation can quickly
     <strong>
      fizzle
     </strong>
     <strong>
      out
     </strong>
     , and a class can help avoid this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nowadays, there are also apps for meeting new people, like Bumble
     <strong>
      BFF
     </strong>
     or Meetup. Dr Robert Puff who writes for Psychology Today says
     <strong>
      solid
     </strong>
     <strong>
      friendships
     </strong>
     are essential for two main reasons. One is to help make life more enjoyable, and two is for support in difficult times – to make hardships more tolerable!
    </p>
    <p>
     As we grow up, we can feel like we're not in control of what's happening around us, but we can control our
     <strong>
      social
     </strong>
     <strong>
      life
     </strong>
     , so
     <strong>
      enrich
     </strong>
     your life with fulfilling friendships.
