     Sometimes life doesn’t seem to
     <strong>
      play fair
     </strong>
     . It
     <strong>
      blindsides
     </strong>
     you at the most
     <strong>
      inopportune
     </strong>
     moments, and even if we can learn to
     <strong>
      grin and bear
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      ups and downs
     </strong>
     , they can take their toll on our
     <strong>
      psyche
     </strong>
     . So rather than
     <strong>
      suffer in silence
     </strong>
     or let these things
     <strong>
      get you down
     </strong>
     , maybe there is another way: what if humour can help you
     <strong>
      get through
     </strong>
     the dark times?
    </p>
    <p>
     According to author and clinician Kristen Lee: “Laughter and tears are both therapeutic – we need both to process such hard times.” But how can we find the
     <strong>
      tough
     </strong>
     things that happen funny? Our lives are really serious, often filled with
     <strong>
      mundane
     </strong>
     and repetitive activities, whether it’s arbitrary bill paying or fighting for a seat on your commute, we need to make time for fun and play – enjoy the
     <strong>
      little things.
     </strong>
     Why not make funny noises to remind you to stop taking things seriously, or learn some silly jokes, just to tell when times get hard? They could make you or other people around you laugh!
    </p>
    <p>
     When a
     <strong>
      hurdle
     </strong>
     pops up in life, it’s easy to
     <strong>
      get
     </strong>
     <strong>
      bogged down
     </strong>
     – but the way we recount events can impact on our resilience. Rather than see the negatives, look for the
     <strong>
      ironic
     </strong>
     moments and tell people about them! Why not write
     <strong>
      parodies
     </strong>
     in your spare time about events that take place to help you
     <strong>
      compartmentalise
     </strong>
     ? Script what happened as if it was happening to a character rather than yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
     We all know that some things in life aren’t fair. But take those events and
     <strong>
      send them up
     </strong>
     a bit in your scripts! Sometimes life needs a bit of a
     <strong>
      roasting
     </strong>
     to get your thoughts in order, and
     <strong>
      embracing
     </strong>
     your comedic side, seeing life’s difficult moments as obstacles that can be
     <strong>
      made fun of
     </strong>
     rather than overwhelm you, may help you get through them more easily. And who knows, you may just discover a talent for writing at the end of it.
