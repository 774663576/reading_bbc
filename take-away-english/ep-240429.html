     人们普遍认为腰疼背疼和不正确的坐姿有直接关系。然而，一些研究得出的结论是没有足够的科学依据能证明低头垂肩、弯腰驼背会引起背痛。不过科学家们普遍认为我们应避免长时间保持一个姿势，静止不动。本文讨论低头垂肩是否会影响健康。

     We hear family members and teachers telling us to "sit up straight" and "stand tall", but do they say that because an
     <strong>
      erect posture
     </strong>
     is more
     <strong>
      aesthetically pleasing
     </strong>
     , or is it the key to a
     <strong>
      pain-free
     </strong>
     back? It's commonly believed that '
     <strong>
      slump
     </strong>
     '
     <strong>
      sitting
     </strong>
     or '
     <strong>
      slouch
     </strong>
     '
     <strong>
      standing
     </strong>
     damages our
     <strong>
      spines
     </strong>
     . But, is slouching really that bad?
    </p>
    <p>
     Meghan Markowski,
     <strong>
      physiotherapist
     </strong>
     at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, says that a poor posture can lead to neck pain and back problems. She also links it to other problems like poor balance, headaches and breathing difficulties. Meghan says we should aim for an
     <strong>
      upright
     </strong>
     spine position and to avoid
     <strong>
      flexing
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      arching
     </strong>
     our backs. But, if you're a
     <strong>
      sloucher
     </strong>
     , there may be some good news coming from the last two decades of research…
    </p>
    <p>
     In an article called "Sit Up Straight: Time to Re-evaluate", physiotherapist Diane Slater and colleagues review the current research and conclude that there is no strong evidence that slouching
     <strong>
      aggravates
     </strong>
     back pain, or even that a perfect posture exists. Instead, they argue that differences in our
     <strong>
      spinal curvatures
     </strong>
     are a fact of life, and that our backs are stronger than we think.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, we're not sure that slouching causes back pain, but have you ever felt like slouching puts you in a worse mood? A 2014 study by Johannes Michalak and colleagues found that depressed participants in a slumped seated position remembered more negative words than positive, but this improved once they sat upright. That means that the way we sit might make us feel more negative. Should we sit up straight and stand tall then?
    </p>
    <p>
     Something both sides seem to agree on is that we should avoid staying in one
     <strong>
      static
     </strong>
     posture throughout the day – we should change positions and stretch. The human spine is designed to be
     <strong>
      on the move
     </strong>
     and a
     <strong>
      sedentary
     </strong>
     lifestyle can increase the risk of back pain. If you're unable to do this, slouching in front of your computer all day may cause you
     <strong>
      discomfort
     </strong>
     , but the evidence tells us it's not actually damaging your spine.
