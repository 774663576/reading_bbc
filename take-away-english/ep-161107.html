     <strong>
      词汇:爱情
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     I'm sure we all remember a time when we
     <strong>
      fell in love
     </strong>
     . For some it was a gradual realisation that the person you knew was actually amazing. For others, it was
     <strong>
      love at first sight
     </strong>
     – an instant
     <strong>
      lightning-bolt moment
     </strong>
     that you knew you'd met your
     <strong>
      perfect match
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     What is it that makes someone instantly love someone?
     <strong>
      Physical attraction
     </strong>
     is an obvious answer but there are other reasons that can create
     <strong>
      affection
     </strong>
     for someone; compatibility, personality and
     <strong>
      a good sense of humour
     </strong>
     to name just a few.
    </p>
    <p>
     But according to one expert, there is a more scientific explanation. Dr Anna Machin, an Evolutionary Anthropologist at the University of Oxford says men look for signs of fertility and good health in a partner "and the major indicator of that in women is the
     <strong>
      waist-hip ratio
     </strong>
     … the absolute ideal." This is believed to be 0.7 which is "really your classic
     <strong>
      hourglass figure
     </strong>
     ." And what do women look for in men? Well other experts have discovered they look for men who are taller, with broad shoulders and a relatively narrow waist – so a 'V' shaped
     <strong>
      torso
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're worried your figure isn't the perfect shape, there could be other factors that will cause someone
     <strong>
      to fall head over heels in love
     </strong>
     with you – people also use their sense of smell to sniff out their ideal
     <strong>
      mate.
     </strong>
     Apparently, we can detect whether people are genetically different to us by the way they smell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if a potential partner's smell is
     <strong>
      a passion-killer
     </strong>
     , their facial expressions might make you
     <strong>
      infatuated
     </strong>
     with them. According to Professor David Perrett, at the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews University, "we can change our faces by interacting with others and doing so in a pleasant manner, and that will aid our attractiveness and make others interested in us."
    </p>
    <p>
     So it's good to know there are many reasons why we might be
     <strong>
      smitten
     </strong>
     with someone, but there is a problem; will the feeling be
     <strong>
      mutual
     </strong>
     and if it is, how long will it last? Nothing is guaranteed and, we know from Shakespeare,
     <strong>
      the course of true love never ran smoothly
     </strong>
     !
