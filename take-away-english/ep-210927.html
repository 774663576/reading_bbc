     Artificial intelligence becoming self-aware and exterminating the human race is a common theme in science fiction. But the levels of high intelligence that AI could reach is a real concern among some scientists. But with more talk of AI and smart devices in the home, what are the positives of bringing these things into your life?
    </p>
    <p>
     Hans Rosling, a professor of international health, once spoke about the
     <strong>
      impact
     </strong>
     and changes that the washing machine made. The once
     <strong>
      arduous
     </strong>
     task of cleaning clothes by hand was taken on by a machine and
     <strong>
      freed up
     </strong>
     more time for other activities. There are so many smart devices that you can fill your home with. Imagine waking up to find a
     <strong>
      piping
     </strong>
     <strong>
      hot
     </strong>
     , freshly brewed cup of coffee,
     <strong>
      spotless
     </strong>
     floors that have been recently
     <strong>
      vacuumed
     </strong>
     and the house set to the perfect
     <strong>
      temperature
     </strong>
     . With smart devices, these things can happen while you sleep. The potential to
     <strong>
      pre-program
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      automate
     </strong>
     parts of your life means that you can focus on other tasks in your life.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there is a difference between smart devices and AI. Smart devices are the things that get on with the tasks, while AI can ‘think’ or interact, and can be used to control the smart devices. There are many
     <strong>
      voice-activated
     </strong>
     AI systems which can control the smart devices around your home. You can ask these devices to start making coffee,
     <strong>
      dim
     </strong>
     the lights when they’re too bright or even make sure the house is
     <strong>
      secure
     </strong>
     . You can inquire as to the weather outside, ask them to
     <strong>
      blare out
     </strong>
     music or search the internet for you when you have a burning question about history or the latest cooking recipes. Some of these devices even have a sense of humour, and upon asking them certain questions, they will retort. In short, in some ways, they can act as company.
    </p>
    <p>
     But how far will it go? Well, we already have
     <strong>
      self-driving
     </strong>
     cars and
     <strong>
      sentient
     </strong>
     tech that can automatically order the delivery of certain products to
     <strong>
      restock
     </strong>
     our fridge when we’re
     <strong>
      running low
     </strong>
     , but often in films and games we see
     <strong>
      humanoid
     </strong>
     robots taking over all of the domestic duties. It seems for now, that those things only live in our imaginations, but we could be seeing them sooner than we think.
