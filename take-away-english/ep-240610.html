     英国阴雨绵绵、变幻莫测的天气是许多人茶余饭后乐此不疲的谈资。即便是在气温回暖、万物复苏、百花盛开的春天，英国也因多发 “April showers（四月阵雨）” 而闻名。究竟有哪些因素造成了英国的这种天气现象？本期 “随身英语” 探讨为何英国的四月总是阵雨连连。

     "Take your
     <strong>
      brolly
     </strong>
     , it's
     <strong>
      chucking it down
     </strong>
     !" The UK is famous for its rainy weather, and Brits LOVE to complain about it – particularly when the arrival of spring teases us with warmth and light, but with them come the 'April
     <strong>
      showers
     </strong>
     ', lovingly shared by Britain, Ireland and some of coastal northern Europe. What exactly are they, and why do they insist on coming every year?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Meteorologists
     </strong>
     differentiate between rain and showers. The UK's national weather service, the Met Office, says that rain is
     <strong>
      precipitation
     </strong>
     brought by a
     <strong>
      weather front
     </strong>
     , is usually long-lasting, and stretches over large areas, whereas showers fall from individual clouds and are characterised by
     <strong>
      intermittent
     </strong>
     patterns. So, it can be sunny one minute, and the next you're getting caught in a large
     <strong>
      downpour
     </strong>
     , but then ten minutes later, you can put away your
     <strong>
      waterproof
     </strong>
     jacket and get your
     <strong>
      sunnies
     </strong>
     out!
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what's responsible? Rob Thompson, meteorologist at the University of Reading, says that as the hot air rises, it forms the
     <strong>
      cumulus
     </strong>
     clouds that produce showers. These are then driven by the
     <strong>
      jet stream
     </strong>
     – strong winds that move northwards during spring – creating rather
     <strong>
      unsettled
     </strong>
     and unpredictable weather. Besides the
     <strong>
      drizzle
     </strong>
     , we're just as likely to experience snow as we are to feel sun as strong as that in late August!
    </p>
    <p>
     With all this in mind, would it surprise you to hear that April is actually one of the driest months of the whole year? In 2021, data company Statista recorded 137.6mm of
     <strong>
      rainfall
     </strong>
     in January, compared to just 20.1mm in April, with similar results for the last four years. That's because while there are lots of rainy days in April, the showers are
     <strong>
      scattered
     </strong>
     , and there aren't as many of the long downpours we see in the winter months. But, this is likely to change as the world warms up. Weather that causes
     <strong>
      flash floods
     </strong>
     is predicted to be four times as frequent in Britain by the 2070s, according to a study by Elizabeth Kendon and colleagues, published in Nature Communications.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is a British proverb that goes "March winds and April showers bring forth May flowers". It is a reminder that, despite our complaints, April showers can be a symbol for renewal and new beginnings. So Brits, instead of complaining about the
     <strong>
      drizzly
     </strong>
     days, why not romanticise that
     <strong>
      pitter-patter
     </strong>
     sound that brings us the colourful spring bloom?

     1. Where are April showers commonly experienced?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      April showers are commonly experienced in Britain, Ireland and some of coastal
     </strong>
     <strong>
      northern Europe.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. How does the Met Office differentiate between rain and showers?
    </p>

     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. What creates the unsettled weather in April?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The unsettled weather in April is created because hot air rises, which forms
     </strong>
     <strong>
      Cumulus clouds. These are then driven by the jet stream.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. True or False?
     <em>
      April is the wettest month in the whole year.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>

      False. April is one of the driest months in the whole year, despite frequent
     </strong>
     <strong>
      showers.
