     关于睡眠状态下的人类大脑活动仍有许多待我们研究的地方，不过梦也许能给我们提供一些相关线索。本文探讨大脑学习外语的方式及梦里用外语交流对语言学习有何意义。

      词汇：language learning 语言学习

    <p>
     It is often said that if we dream in a foreign language, it's a sign that we are
     <strong>
      making progress
     </strong>
     in learning that language. But is it true?
    </p>
    <p>
     Before we can look at
     <strong>
      multilingual
     </strong>
     dreams, first we need to look at sleep. The link between sleep and language can be
     <strong>
      applied
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     how we learn any language, including our
     <strong>
      mother tongue
     </strong>
     . Even adults still learn about one new word every two days in their first language, but, if we are going to have a
     <strong>
      firm grasp of
     </strong>
     that new word, we need to link it to our
     <strong>
      existing knowledge
     </strong>
     . And in order to do that, we 'need to have some sleep', says Gareth Gaskell, a psychology professor at the University of York.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's during sleep that the
     <strong>
      integration
     </strong>
     of old and new knowledge happens. At night, one part of our brain – the
     <strong>
      hippocampus
     </strong>
     – takes whatever new information it
     <strong>
      soaked up
     </strong>
     in the day, and passes it on to other parts of the brain to be
     <strong>
      stored
     </strong>
     . The role that dreams play in this night-time
     <strong>
      learning process
     </strong>
     is still being studied, but 'it's entirely possible that during multilingual dreams, the brain is trying to connect two languages', says Marc Züst, researcher at the University Hospital of Old Age Psychiatry and Psychotherapy in Bern, Switzerland.
    </p>
    <p>
     So having multilingual dreams could mean that our brain is trying to
     <strong>
      master
     </strong>
     a new word or phrase, for example, but it could also have an emotional
     <strong>
      significance
     </strong>
     . Danuta Gabryś-Barker, a professor of
     <strong>
      psycholinguistics
     </strong>
     at the University of Silesia in Poland, suggests that multilingual dreams can
     <strong>
      express
     </strong>
     'fears and
     <strong>
      desires
     </strong>
     ' around learning a foreign language, including the wish to be a
     <strong>
      native-like
     </strong>
     speaker or to be accepted within a certain community.
    </p>
    <p>
     We clearly still have a lot to learn about multilingual dreams, but one thing seems certain: if you're trying to learn a new language, you should definitely
     <strong>
      sleep on it
     </strong>
     .
