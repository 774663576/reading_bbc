     Do you prefer to watch TV or listen to the radio? There was a time when some people thought moving pictures
     <strong>
      beamed
     </strong>
     live into our houses would spell the end of
     <strong>
      tuning in
     </strong>
     to the radio for entertainment and information. But radio survived and flourished. And now, despite the growth in sophisticated smartphones offering
     <strong>
      high-definition
     </strong>
     pictures, the popularity of
     <strong>
      podcasts
     </strong>
     is booming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps the growth in
     <strong>
      podcasting
     </strong>
     is not surprising – it offers a
     <strong>
      digital audio file
     </strong>
     that can be
     <strong>
      downloaded
     </strong>
     and stored for listening at any time. It can also be
     <strong>
      streamed
     </strong>
     from the internet and played on a computer or MP3 player. And it’s not just
     <strong>
      broadcasters
     </strong>
     , like the BBC, who are producing podcasts: now commercial broadcasters, individuals and companies with no connection to broadcasting are making them. In fact, anyone with something to say, and a few pounds to spend on the equipment, can get involved.
    </p>
    <p>
     But where did this trend for making
     <strong>
      portable
     </strong>
     audio programmes begin? Journalist Ben Hammersley told the BBC that “two changes transformed the market – one cultural and one
     <strong>
      technical
     </strong>
     .” Apple launched the iPhone podcast app,
     <strong>
      recording and editing equipment
     </strong>
     became cheaper, and 4G mobile phone connections and Wi-Fi became widespread.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Technological development
     </strong>
     has driven many changes in our media
     <strong>
      consumption
     </strong>
     habits. But however good the tech may be, there still needs to be something worth watching or listening to. The BBC’s Jamie Robertson writes that for podcasts, Serial - a piece of non-fiction investigative journalism –
     <strong>
      captured people’s imagination
     </strong>
     . It was a piece of
     <strong>
      high-quality
     </strong>
     audio with a gripping story. To date, the first and second seasons of the show have had more than 340 million
     <strong>
      downloads
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Advertisers
     </strong>
     soon realised the money-making potential of this and other successful podcasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now there are podcasts about anything and everything - even the educational content that BBC Learning English offers! And these
     <strong>
      aural
     </strong>
     treats are available on a wide range of
     <strong>
      platforms
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Audiences
     </strong>
     are very specific, which can help advertisers target what they want to promote. And if there isn’t a podcast to suit your interests, you can now easily make and
     <strong>
      distribute
     </strong>
     them - and become your very own broadcaster.
