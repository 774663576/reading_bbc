     有很多人都认为自己能够辨别他人是否在说谎。但研究表明事实并非如此：我们其实更倾向于过度分析他人的行为举止并依赖错误的假设进行判断，因此做出的结论还不如相信自己的直觉准确。本文探讨为何识破谎言如此之难。

     <strong>
      Squirming
     </strong>
     in their seat,
     <strong>
      glancing
     </strong>
     around the room and never
     <strong>
      looking you in the eye
     </strong>
     . We think we know when someone is lying to us, but do we really?
    </p>
    <p>
     A study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Review showed that people's ability to tell if someone is lying to them is little better than 50%. Interestingly, other research suggests that we are actually quite good at
     <strong>
      unconsciously
     </strong>
     <strong>
      spotting
     </strong>
     liars, but our
     <strong>
      conscious
     </strong>
     thoughts overrule this. Forensic Scientist R. Edward Geiselman points out that training in recognising liars doesn't always help, saying "quick, inadequate training sessions lead people to
     <strong>
      over-analyse
     </strong>
     and to do worse than if they go with their
     <strong>
      gut reactions
     </strong>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     One reason for this may be '
     <strong>
      truth bias
     </strong>
     '. Experts have suggested that we are usually
     <strong>
      biased
     </strong>
     to believe that people are telling us the truth, at least in most contexts. Another reason that might make us bad at identifying liars is that there are a number of myths around body language and lying. Many of us believe that liars are unlikely to look us in the eye or will
     <strong>
      fidget
     </strong>
     in their seat. However, this isn't necessarily the case. Professor of psychology Kevin Colwell suggests that liars often work hard to
     <strong>
      disguise
     </strong>
     these behaviours. It may be that not looking away, or sitting more still than usual, are actually the
     <strong>
      giveaways
     </strong>
     that someone is not telling the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     To see how someone's
     <strong>
      behaviour
     </strong>
     really changes as they lie, many experts recommend observing people talking about things known to be true. This allows us to
     <strong>
      establish
     </strong>
     a
     <strong>
      baseline
     </strong>
     of their normal behaviours while speaking. Any differences to this baseline behaviour could show that someone is lying. This is why it's much harder to lie to people who know us well.
    </p>
    <p>
     As liars may be working hard to
     <strong>
      conceal
     </strong>
     their behaviours, some psychologists have suggested increasing the effort needed for this by asking them to tell their story backwards. When faced with this increased
     <strong>
      cognitive load
     </strong>
     , any
     <strong>
      behavioural
     </strong>
     <strong>
      tell-tale signs
     </strong>
     are magnified.
    </p>
    <p>
     It can be hard to spot liars. We are likely to trust people, and behaviours can be hidden, but if we know someone well, and if someone is working too hard to
     <strong>
      stick to
     </strong>
     their story, it's possible to
     <strong>
      see through
     </strong>
     people who are not telling the truth.

     1. True or False?
     <em>
      People are good at spotting liars unconsciously.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      True. The article says that people are quite good at unconsciously spotting liars.
      <br/>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Why can quick training in spotting liars be a problem?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Training sessions that are not good enough can lead people to over-analyse someone's behaviour and get worse results than if they trust their intuition.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Why might liars sit more still than usual?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Liars may sit more still than usual because they are trying to disguise their behaviour.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. What is important if we want to see how someone’s behaviour changes?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      It is important to establish a baseline of how they normally behave.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. What technique makes it difficult for people to conceal lies?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Having to tell a story backwards increases the cognitive load and makes it more difficult to conceal that you are lying.
     </strong>
