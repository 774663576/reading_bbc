     If you're a sports fan, you may be familiar with the
     <strong>
      emotional rollercoaster
     </strong>
     that comes with sports
     <strong>
      spectatorship
     </strong>
     . Whether you're part of a
     <strong>
      buzzing crowd
     </strong>
     in a stadium, or just watching at home on TV, it's easy to get caught up in the highs and the lows when you celebrate or
     <strong>
      commiserate
     </strong>
     with your favourite team or athlete. Those feelings are so strong, in fact, that a study from Croatia, published in PubMed, showed that the emotional stress during a football match increased the risk of a
     <strong>
      cardiovascular
     </strong>
     incident. But can watching sports be good for you too?
    </p>
    <p>
     The evidence suggests that people who watch live sporting events experience greater
     <strong>
      wellbeing
     </strong>
     than those who don't. A study published in Frontiers in Public Health by the Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, found sports
     <strong>
      spectators
     </strong>
     felt less lonely and had higher scores for life satisfaction. Lead author Helen Keys said in a press release, "watching live sport of all types provides many opportunities for social interaction and this helps to
     <strong>
      forge
     </strong>
     group identity and
     <strong>
      belonging
     </strong>
     ." She says this then reduces loneliness and boosts wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, if for any reason you aren't keen on going to live events, don't worry! Watching sports on TV or on the internet may also have positive effects, according to a 2021 study by Tsuji and colleagues. They found that older adults who watched sports were less likely to have
     <strong>
      depressive symptoms
     </strong>
     than those who didn't. On top of that, the sports spectators tended to have richer
     <strong>
      social networks
     </strong>
     than non-spectators. The authors suggest that the social networks you gain through watching sports may lower the risk of depressive symptoms.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the
     <strong>
      cheers
     </strong>
     at a live sports event or even casual
     <strong>
      chit-chat
     </strong>
     with friends about your favourite team can bring a sense of
     <strong>
      camaraderie
     </strong>
     and may reduce loneliness and depression. It seems the health benefits of sports are not limited to physical activity through participation in them, but that we can make gains in our general wellbeing through
     <strong>
      social bonding
     </strong>
     .
