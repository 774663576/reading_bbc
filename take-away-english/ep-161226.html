      Vocabulary: driverless cars 词汇：无人驾驶汽车
     </strong>

    <p>
     As the
     <strong>
      relentless
     </strong>
     <strong>
      pace
     </strong>
     of technology continues to advance, companies must
     <strong>
      adapt
     </strong>
     or get left behind. One of the key areas of
     <strong>
      contention
     </strong>
     these days is the driverless car.
     <strong>
      Autonomous
     </strong>
     cars have long been featured in science fiction movies and books, but in recent years they have moved from a
     <strong>
      pipe dream
     </strong>
     to a reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     The development of the autonomous car actually started in the 1920s, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the first
     <strong>
      prototypes
     </strong>
     were successfully created, one of which was designed by Mercedes-Benz.
    </p>
    <p>
     Since then the technology has
     <strong>
      gone from strength to strength
     </strong>
     and these days many companies are
     <strong>
      jumping on the bandwagon
     </strong>
     . Uber is the latest to announce its plan to
     <strong>
      unroll
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a fleet of
     </strong>
     driverless
     <strong>
      cars
     </strong>
     . It follows Apple and Ford, who have announced similar plans, and Google and Tesla, who already have autonomous cars on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two questions arise: Do we really need them? And are they really safe?
     <strong>
      Advocates
     </strong>
     of driverless cars would argue 'yes' to both.
     <strong>
      Vehicular
     </strong>
     <strong>
      autonomy
     </strong>
     , if perfected, could lead to much safer road conditions for all, lower insurance costs and enhance
     <strong>
      mobility
     </strong>
     for the elderly, the sick and those with disabilities. They would also allow roads to increase their
     <strong>
      capacity
     </strong>
     between 200 – 400%.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perfection, though, seems to be just
     <strong>
      out of reach
     </strong>
     at the moment. To date Google's self-driving car, launched in 2012, has had 14 minor accidents. Even worse, Tesla's Autopilot has caused one
     <strong>
      fatality
     </strong>
     in 2015, where the vehicle simply did not see the obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the technology exists, driverless cars and full vehicular autonomy is still
     <strong>
      embryonic
     </strong>
     . That said, you can rest assured that further development in the field is
     <strong>
      inevitable
     </strong>
     . And what’s the future? Well, George Marcus, co-founder of Geometric Intelligence – Uber's autonomous development department – imagines a world of flying cars taking us to work. He says "They're going to allow people to take long commutes at 75 or 150 mph where you'd otherwise get stuck in traffic. It's really, in a not-too-distant future, going to be something that is practical." Wouldn't that be fine?
