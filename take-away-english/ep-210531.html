     Do you like to
     <strong>
      keep fit
     </strong>
     ? We’re always told that regular
     <strong>
      exercise
     </strong>
     is good for our body and mind. More and more people are taking up activities that improve their fitness. But is there a risk some of us might get obsessed and overdo it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, for some people, fitness has become an
     <strong>
      obsession
     </strong>
     as they aim for
     <strong>
      perfection
     </strong>
     . And
     <strong>
      fitness trackers
     </strong>
     and apps can add to this
     <strong>
      addiction
     </strong>
     , especially if someone is driven by
     <strong>
      achievement
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      perfectionism
     </strong>
     . And sharing data on social media means exercising becomes public and
     <strong>
      competitive
     </strong>
     , which could cause problems in someone who is vulnerable.
    </p>
    <p>
     Experts say this can lead to a medical condition called
     <strong>
      orthorexia nervosa
     </strong>
     , or addiction to ‘healthy’ eating and over-exercise. Untreated, it can lead to
     <strong>
      malnutrition
     </strong>
     and mental health complications. According to a BBC Worklife article: “Research from scientists at University College London in 2017 found that higher Instagram usage was associated with increased likelihood of developing orthorexia, especially among followers of the ‘healthy eating’ influencers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Too much exercise can also
     <strong>
      take its toll
     </strong>
     on someone’s physical health as well. Symptoms of over-exercising include injuries such as
     <strong>
      stress fractures
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      tendinitis
     </strong>
     and a
     <strong>
      low immune system
     </strong>
     . So how much exercise is too much? Research by the Journal of the American College of Cardiology found the ideal pace to
     <strong>
      jog
     </strong>
     was about eight kilometres per hour – and that it was best to jog no more than three times a week or for 2.5 hours in total, showing that moderate jogging is possibly more beneficial than being
     <strong>
      inactive
     </strong>
     or undertaking
     <strong>
      strenuous
     </strong>
     jogging.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you’re more of a
     <strong>
      couch potato
     </strong>
     than a
     <strong>
      sprinter
     </strong>
     , this might sound like good news. But for
     <strong>
      amateur
     </strong>
     athletes who can’t help but push their bodies
     <strong>
      to the limit
     </strong>
     , the advice from Martin Turner, a sports and exercise psychologist, is, “it’s all about
     <strong>
      letting go
     </strong>
     , not being obsessed, learning not to control everything, saying, ‘You don’t need to be perfect.’”
