     有没有某种气味一下就唤起了你对旧人旧事的记忆？气味与我们的性格和记忆之间似乎存在着心理层面的联系。我们出生时，大脑中处理气味的区域是空的，人们对气味的反应是后天习得的，因此也就各不相同。有一些研究甚至表明，某些气味会影响我们的认知。本期节目探讨气味的力量。

     Have you ever caught a
     <strong>
      whiff
     </strong>
     of something and been strongly reminded of a person or place? It seems there is a deep
     <strong>
      psychological
     </strong>
     link between
     <strong>
      smells
     </strong>
     , our personality and our memory. Some research even suggests that smells can influence our
     <strong>
      cognition
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, why do smells
     <strong>
      take us back
     </strong>
     ? Roja Dove, a
     <strong>
      perfumer
     </strong>
     , told the BBC that when we are born, the
     <strong>
      olfactory bulb
     </strong>
     , which is the area in our brain that processes smell, is empty. Therefore, our responses to smell are learnt and very personal to the individual. This means that when we smell an
     <strong>
      odour
     </strong>
     again, the original and unique memory comes
     <strong>
      flooding back
     </strong>
     because of the association.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our awareness of smells is primarily
     <strong>
      unconscious
     </strong>
     , according to Andreas Keller from the Department of Philosophy at City University of New York. This means we are not actively aware of them unless they are extremely strong. But,
     <strong>
      low
     </strong>
     -
     <strong>
      level
     </strong>
     smells are still
     <strong>
      picked up
     </strong>
     because the
     <strong>
      scent receptors
     </strong>
     in our brain are so powerful that we unconsciously register them. In fact, various studies have found the olfactory bulb sends more
     <strong>
      neurons
     </strong>
     to more areas of our brain than our
     <strong>
      hearing
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      vision
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-paragraph">
     Research suggests that the power of smell can also affect how the brain performs, especially when it comes to the
     <strong>
      aroma
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      essential oils.
     </strong>
     Mark Moss, from the Department of Psychology at Northumbria University, found that
     <strong>
      sage
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      peppermint
     </strong>
     show general positive effects on cognition while the smell of
     <strong>
      rosemary
     </strong>
     can enhance our memory. He also investigated
     <strong>
      lavender
     </strong>
     which he says "tends to impair memory and slow down reaction time. But research by others have [has] shown it to be useful in reducing pre-treatment anxiety in dental and medical situations".

    <p class="ssrcss-1q0x1qg-paragraph">
     So, don't take your nose for granted. It really is powerful!
