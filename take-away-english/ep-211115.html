     It’s difficult not to admire the talent of a skilled musician. Whether it be a
     <strong>
      pianist
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      flautist
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      cellist
     </strong>
     , these individuals have shown
     <strong>
      dedication
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      passion
     </strong>
     over a long period of time to reach the highest levels of performance. But they say it’s never too late to learn. So what are the benefits, for both children and adults, in learning a musical instrument?
    </p>
    <p>
     Learning to play a musical instrument when growing up can improve hearing in adulthood. According to a study by Dr Nina Kraus, Professor of Neurobiology at Northwestern University in Illinois, US, children who played musical instruments were better at recognising different
     <strong>
      frequencies
     </strong>
     . This improved hearing skill carried over into later life with adults who had once played an instrument able to discern sounds of different
     <strong>
      pitches
     </strong>
     more easily. And it could also have some academic benefits too. A study conducted by the University of British Columbia found that students who engaged in music-related activities during grades 7-12 scored significantly higher in science, English and maths.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there are not just benefits to children. Whether you choose to play the piano,
     <strong>
      pick
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      strum
     </strong>
     a
     <strong>
      guitar
     </strong>
     or learn a
     <strong>
      drumbeat
     </strong>
     , you could end up joining a
     <strong>
      band
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      orchestra
     </strong>
     . This in turn could improve your social life, meeting other
     <strong>
      bandmates
     </strong>
     who are likeminded in their love of a good
     <strong>
      tune
     </strong>
     . Learning an instrument can also give you a sense of achievement.
     <strong>
      Nailing
     </strong>
     that perfect
     <strong>
      chord
     </strong>
     is one way, but what if you got together with a bunch of friends and entered into a
     <strong>
      battle of the bands
     </strong>
     – and won?
    </p>
    <p>
     So, whether you’re looking to destress playing out some chords, or improve your grades at school, maybe taking up an instrument could help you.
