     New parents often spend a long time
     <strong>
      debating
     </strong>
     what to call their
     <strong>
      newborn
     </strong>
     . Should they
     <strong>
      name
     </strong>
     <strong>
      them
     </strong>
     <strong>
      after
     </strong>
     a relative, a famous person or just pick a name at random? For many of us it can be quite the
     <strong>
      gruelling
     </strong>
     task, but it’s our children who need to live with our choice. So, how important is the name you choose?
    </p>
    <p>
     Names usually stay with us for a lifetime, unless we decide to change them. They become part of our identity. Quite often we hear stories of celebrities giving their children unusual names, while other people give their children names which have special meanings, for example, the name Sarah comes from a Hebrew word meaning ‘princess’. Sadly, though, our parents don’t always get it right.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what if you don’t like your
     <strong>
      given name
     </strong>
     ? A study led by psychologist Jean Twenge found that a person who hates the
     <strong>
      moniker
     </strong>
     given to them is more likely to have greater psychological
     <strong>
      adjustment
     </strong>
     issues – possibly due to low
     <strong>
      self-esteem
     </strong>
     . This is because our title becomes a
     <strong>
      symbol
     </strong>
     of our self, and if we loathe our name, our confidence may be affected.
    </p>
    <p>
     And what if your name is no longer popular? While names like Ethel and Gladys were once in fashion, they now sound a bit
     <strong>
      out of date
     </strong>
     , which can be embarrassing. And when it comes to unpopular names which aren’t
     <strong>
      trending
     </strong>
     , they may even affect our love lives. Studies have shown that people with
     <strong>
      old-fashioned
     </strong>
     names are more likely to be rejected on dating apps.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, if you choose an unusual name, it’s not all bad news. According to a study conducted by Professor David Zhu, people with uncommon names can develop a sense of
     <strong>
      uniqueness
     </strong>
     and can often become more creative and open-minded.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, when choosing your
     <strong>
      offspring
     </strong>
     ’s name, there are a fair few things to consider – but going for something too common or too old-fashioned may not be a great choice. And, if your children hate your choice, they can always select a
     <strong>
      nickname
     </strong>
     .
