     Suddenly a sound rings out, stopping you in your tracks. Panicking, you search for where it could be coming from. It's your phone, and if you're like a quarter of 18 to 34-year-olds in a recent British study, you probably won't answer it. The same study found that 70% of people in this age group prefer
     <strong>
      text messages
     </strong>
     to phone calls. Why do so many people hate phone calls?
    </p>
    <p>
     While previous generations grew up using
     <strong>
      landlines
     </strong>
     to talk to their friends,
     <strong>
      smartphone-equipped
     </strong>
     younger people have grown up accustomed to using text messages,
     <strong>
      group chats
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      voice notes
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      social conversations
     </strong>
     . What these
     <strong>
      media
     </strong>
     have in common is that they are
     <strong>
      asynchronous
     </strong>
     – they don't need to happen in
     <strong>
      real time
     </strong>
     . When you can craft a reply free of
     <strong>
      interruption
     </strong>
     , you have greater control over your
     <strong>
      contributions
     </strong>
     to a conversation. It also means that you can reply when it's best for you.
     <strong>
      Synchronous
     </strong>
     communication, like phone calls or
     <strong>
      face-to-face
     </strong>
     conversations, can lead people to feel a loss of control and the corresponding
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     . Coupled to this is that fact that many young people report associating phone calls, particularly those without
     <strong>
      prior warning
     </strong>
     , with bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
     This means that new
     <strong>
      social codes
     </strong>
     are being established. Many people will now
     <strong>
      text
     </strong>
     someone to see if they're
     <strong>
      available
     </strong>
     to take a phone call. If someone doesn't feel able to sum something up in a few short messages, they might leave a long voice note. Could it be that not wanting to
     <strong>
      intrude
     </strong>
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     someone with a sudden phone call is just a question of good manners and
     <strong>
      respecting someone's boundaries
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe, but this doesn't mean that anxiety around communication has been eliminated. Texting may be asynchronous, but many people report tensions from being '
     <strong>
      left on read
     </strong>
     ' – when you know someone has read your message, but they don't, or won't, reply. Many would agree with British writer Daisy Buchanan, who reminds us how
     <strong>
      picking up
     </strong>
     the phone to talk to someone can be far more effective at relieving tension than a series of awkward messages. So, are these new social codes better at respecting boundaries, or are they just creating a whole new set of potential anxieties?
