     虚拟假期 “virtual holiday” 能让你在预算和时间有限、或者没有护照的情况下到遥远的地方旅游。许多在线服务都能帮助人们足不出户地外出旅行。你可以通过远程游览大英博物馆和印度泰姬陵，甚至通过虚拟的潜水体验看到沉船和珊瑚礁等等。本文讨论互联网和虚拟现实技术带来的旅行体验。

     Have you ever dreamt of strolling along the streets of Venice, climbing the Eiffel Tower or flying above the Grand Canyon? It's much easier to take a
     <strong>
      virtual
     </strong>
     <strong>
      holiday
     </strong>
     now than ever before. Doesn't it sound
     <strong>
      adventurous
     </strong>
     – travelling to
     <strong>
      breathtaking
     </strong>
     <strong>
      destinations
     </strong>
     around the world while never leaving the comfort of your own home?
    </p>
    <p>
     Digital maps let you
     <strong>
      roam
     </strong>
     almost any location on the planet, meaning you can explore the
     <strong>
      night
     </strong>
     <strong>
      markets
     </strong>
     in Bangkok, hover over mountainous regions like the Himalayas or zoom in on tiny islands and imagine you're sunbathing and smelling the sea. Of course, you won't experience the weather and culture in exactly the same way, but at least it's an option.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you are a nature lover, it's possible to take an
     <strong>
      interactive
     </strong>
     virtual tour, with the option of virtual
     <strong>
      commentary
     </strong>
     , of a
     <strong>
      national
     </strong>
     <strong>
      park
     </strong>
     like Yellowstone in the USA. This area has a lot of volcanic activity, so you can watch
     <strong>
      geysers
     </strong>
     erupt, see
     <strong>
      sulphur
     </strong>
     <strong>
      lakes
     </strong>
     and virtually hike iconic
     <strong>
      trails
     </strong>
     . Their website is full of videos walking you to famous
     <strong>
      viewpoints
     </strong>
     like Dragon's Mouth Spring and the cascading waterfall at Upper Falls. And then there are oceanic adventures too. National Geographic offers virtual underwater experiences so you can dive with sharks and other marine life, see coral reefs come alive and explore sunken shipwrecks.
    </p>
    <p>
     You can now
     <strong>
      tour
     </strong>
     many museums and
     <strong>
      landmarks
     </strong>
     virtually too, like The British Museum in London. You can explore more than 60 galleries where you'll see priceless artefacts from around the world, like the Rosetta Stone, and famous paintings and sculptures. The Taj Mahal is another place you can visit virtually and at a 360-degree angle, so you can scale heights that would be almost impossible if you were there in person.
    </p>
    <p>
     They say '
     <strong>
      the world is your oyster
     </strong>
     '. So next time you get the
     <strong>
      travel
     </strong>
     <strong>
      bug
     </strong>
     , try a virtual escape. A
     <strong>
      shoestring
     </strong>
     <strong>
      budget
     </strong>
     is no problem – you can still explore the world, and you don't even need a
     <strong>
      passport
     </strong>
     .

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
     2. What is a downside about virtual travel?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

    <p>
     3. What could you add on to an interactive virtual tour of Yellowstone?
    </p>

      True. National Geographic offers virtual underwater experiences so you can explore sunken shipwrecks.
