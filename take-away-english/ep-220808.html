     单词 “doppelganger” 指的是长得和你一模一样的人，但这个人和你没有血缘关系。找到长相酷似你的那个人的机会很小。你想和另一个 “你” 见面吗？本文谈论人们找到自己的 “doppelganger” 的概率。

    <p>
     What is the likelihood of you having someone who looks just like you? Would it be a good thing? And if you did have one, would you want to meet them?
    </p>
    <p>
     Consider how often your
     <strong>
      facial features
     </strong>
     are used to identify you. Your passport, ID card and driving licence all bare your face. To enter your workplace, you likely need to be
     <strong>
      recognisable
     </strong>
     . You may need your face to unlock your smartphone and possibly even need it to
     <strong>
      exclude
     </strong>
     you from being present at a crime scene.
    </p>
    <p>
     The word ‘doppelganger’ refers to a person who looks the same as you, essentially sharing your features; those that you thought were
     <strong>
      unique
     </strong>
     to you and your
     <strong>
      identity
     </strong>
     . Not an
     <strong>
      identical twin
     </strong>
     , as a doppelganger has no relation to you. The idea originated in German
     <strong>
      folklore
     </strong>
     . A doppelganger was said to be a spirit-double that
     <strong>
      replicated
     </strong>
     every human and beast on earth.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, let’s get real. What are the chances of you having one in the first place? There’s said to be a one in 135 chance of an absolute
     <strong>
      dead ringer
     </strong>
     for you existing anywhere in the world, so the chances are pretty low, despite folk wisdom promising you otherwise. And the chances of meeting? The
     <strong>
      mathematical certainty
     </strong>
     of finding this particular person is supposedly less than one in a trillion!
    </p>
    <p>
     That said, these statistics may be a good thing. Historically, having
     <strong>
      a double
     </strong>
     hasn’t always been a positive. Back in 1999, an innocent American man,
     <strong>
      indistinguishable
     </strong>
     from the real criminal, was sent to prison for robbery, where he stayed for 19 years. In the end, it turned out to be a case of
     <strong>
      mistaken identity
     </strong>
     . In a different case, a woman in New York was accused of trying to poison her doppelganger with deadly cheesecake so that she could steal her identity!
    </p>
    <p>
     And, why are people interested in finding their possible doppelganger anyway? It may be helpful to look to the past when facial
     <strong>
      resemblance
     </strong>
     indicated
     <strong>
      kinship
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe one day you’ll meet your
     <strong>
      lookalike
     </strong>
     , but we understand that, after this, you possibly don’t want to!
