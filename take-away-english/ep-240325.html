     <strong>
      Heartbreak
     </strong>
     has inspired thousands of songs, books and films, and, however much we try to avoid it, is something we are all likely to experience at some point in our lives. But what exactly is heartbreak, and how does it affect us?
    </p>
    <p>
     Heartbreak often occurs after a
     <strong>
      breakup
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      bereavement
     </strong>
     or the
     <strong>
      loss
     </strong>
     of a family member or friend. When this happens, we experience
     <strong>
      grief
     </strong>
     , which heartbreak is a form of. And it doesn't just have
     <strong>
      emotional
     </strong>
     effects – it affects us physically too. The word 'heartbreak' comes from the
     <strong>
      physical
     </strong>
     <strong>
      response
     </strong>
     to loss, described on BBC's The Why Factor as feeling like someone is 'physically squeezing the heart', though our hearts don't experience any real
     <strong>
      damage
     </strong>
     . Psychologist Guy Winch told the BBC that, although we tend to feel pain
     <strong>
      viscerally
     </strong>
     , the pain of heartbreak actually comes from the brain, and is a
     <strong>
      by-product
     </strong>
     of love.
    </p>
    <p>
     The emotional pain may be understandable, but why do we experience such physical pain? According to Florence Williams, author of
     <em>
      Heartbreak: A Personal and Scientific Journey
     </em>
     , when you connect with someone on an
     <strong>
      intimate
     </strong>
     level, your bodies can actually
     <strong>
      sync up
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Cortisol
     </strong>
     <strong>
      levels
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      respiration rates
     </strong>
     can align, and
     <strong>
      heartbeats
     </strong>
     might regulate during sleep. When that partner is no longer there, our body reacts negatively to this change, causing us pain. The reason for this is evolutionary, Williams says. The
     <strong>
      nervous system
     </strong>
     acts as though it is
     <strong>
      under threat
     </strong>
     because, as social animals, we feel far more comfortable and safe with others than when alone. Therefore, the symptoms of heartbreak are a perfectly natural response, however hard they may be to cope with.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you have a broken heart, what can you do? Healthline suggests you should take time to
     <strong>
      grieve
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      reconnect
     </strong>
     with yourself, and surround yourself with
     <strong>
      supportive
     </strong>
     friends.
