     有些成年人似乎永远也长不大。来看看为什么有些人喜欢在业余时间做看似只有在孩童时代才会做的事情，如制作飞机模型、搭建积木套装。有证据表明，这些人其实有充分的理由痴迷于这类爱好。玩儿时的玩具是否说明我们在寻找内心的那个 “大小孩”？听 “随身英语” 节目讨论以玩玩具为兴趣爱好的成年人。

    <p>
     We all know children love to play with
     <strong>
      toys
     </strong>
     . But as they approach
     <strong>
      adulthood
     </strong>
     , they stop being playful and concentrate on grown-up things – or so we believe. However, in recent times at least, adults are revisiting their
     <strong>
      childhood
     </strong>
     and buying toys for themselves – and they've been given the nickname '
     <strong>
      kidults
     </strong>
     '.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many reasons for the rise of the kidult, but it's certainly big business. In the USA for example, the Toy Association says that over half of adults bought toys and games for themselves last year.
     <strong>
      Nostalgia
     </strong>
     is part of the reason: people want to relive their childhood and now have the disposable income to do so.
     <strong>
      Puzzles
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      board games
     </strong>
     are traditional toys that can be enjoyed at any age.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there's more to being a
     <strong>
      big kid
     </strong>
     than just taking
     <strong>
      a trip down memory lane
     </strong>
     . People have more time to
     <strong>
      let their hair down
     </strong>
     and play.
     <strong>
      Hobbies
     </strong>
     such as
     <strong>
      modelling
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      construction
     </strong>
     with plastic bricks can help people develop skills into adulthood. And they allow people to switch off and relax. In fact, Frederique Tutt, global industry analyst at NPD, told the BBC: "I'd say much of this is providing an escape from the stresses and strains of modern-day living, fulfilling our need to find
     <strong>
      downtime
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people are even finding comfort and
     <strong>
      camaraderie
     </strong>
     by playing with others. Although competing with others through
     <strong>
      video gaming
     </strong>
     might be nothing new, others are coming together to build
     <strong>
      train sets
     </strong>
     or sophisticated models. In Brighton in the UK, for example, Brighton Bricks is a club where adult fans of the toy Lego meet up every month to talk, play and swap
     <strong>
      collections
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But those who think playing with toys is childish and
     <strong>
      immature
     </strong>
     should take note of the research by René Proyer, professor of psychology at Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. It suggests that adults who demonstrate more
     <strong>
      playful
     </strong>
     personality traits are more motivated, creative and
     <strong>
      spontaneous
     </strong>
     . So, it seems life shouldn't be
     <strong>
      all work and no play
     </strong>
     , and maybe we should take play more seriously!
