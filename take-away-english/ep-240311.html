      词汇：homesickness 思乡
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Starting a dream job in a new city, winning a place at a prestigious university
     <strong>
      abroad
     </strong>
     or being able to travel for an
     <strong>
      extended period
     </strong>
     . All fantastic opportunities, but they can leave us feeling sad and alone. What is homesickness and what can we do about it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Homesickness is mentioned in Homer's Odyssey – it's nothing new. Common symptoms include sadness,
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      irritability
     </strong>
     . It also can trigger
     <strong>
      self-protection
     </strong>
     responses causing people to
     <strong>
      withdraw
     </strong>
     from activities and become
     <strong>
      apathetic
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      unmotivated
     </strong>
     . Homesickness can affect anyone, but there are some factors that can make people more
     <strong>
      resilient
     </strong>
     when faced by it. Clinical psychologist Christopher Thurber and healthcare professional Edward Walton, tell us that positive previous experiences of being away from home, an
     <strong>
      optimistic outlook
     </strong>
     and a
     <strong>
      settled
     </strong>
     home background can help people deal better with the condition. Homesickness can also be less severe when someone feels in control of their situation, rather than feeling that they have been forced to move.
    </p>
    <p>
     Regardless of these factors, homesickness does affect most people who move away from home. Psychologist Nilufar Ahmed recommends that people acknowledge homesickness, accept that it will happen and
     <strong>
      work through
     </strong>
     their feelings.
     <strong>
      Connections
     </strong>
     are important. Ahmed suggests people seek to fully
     <strong>
      involve
     </strong>
     themselves in their new
     <strong>
      surroundings
     </strong>
     , to focus on the positives of their new environment, get to know new people, and keep themselves
     <strong>
      active
     </strong>
     . She also suggests
     <strong>
      maintaining contact
     </strong>
     with home, through video chats or other means, and also to have reminders of home, such as
     <strong>
      familiar
     </strong>
     food. However, other psychologists, like Thurber and Walton, remind us that it's important that these connections to home do not prevent people taking up new opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some form of homesickness is almost inevitable when we move to a new place. Understanding that this is the case, and taking small steps to lessen the impact, can help us make the most of new opportunities.
