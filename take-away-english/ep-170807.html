     I need help! I have to fix a leaking pipe in my bathroom but I'm not sure where to begin. I know I lack the necessary
     <strong>
      DIY
     </strong>
     skills, but luckily there are numerous books and online videos that will hopefully give me the information I need.
     <strong>
      Publications
     </strong>
     that help us to help ourselves are nothing new, but the range of them is increasing with advice being given far beyond
     <strong>
      practical
     </strong>
     tasks around the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bookshops these days are full of
     <strong>
      titles
     </strong>
     which claim to boost your
     <strong>
      self-confidence
     </strong>
     , your wealth, your love life or your career. Some claim to improve your life within seven days! It's
     <strong>
      big business
     </strong>
     and it's thought that the self-help industry is worth $10bn in the US alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first self-help book called 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' was published in 1936, and has since sold 30 million copies and is still popular now. It includes
     <strong>
      guidance
     </strong>
     on how to make people like you and how to make your life happier. It might seem strange to think that we need a book to tell us how to live our lives but self-help books remain a go to
     <strong>
      remedy
     </strong>
     for those of us looking for
     <strong>
      enlightenment
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     There are, of course,
     <strong>
      trends
     </strong>
     in what we need help with. Emma Marshall, who works at British bookshop Waterstones, says "at the moment we're in the tidying up, getting rid of things trend… I think the trend right now is about slowing down in your life."  It seems there is always something we need help with, and reading about it can be very
     <strong>
      therapeutic
     </strong>
     – it makes us feel good, even if we don't do anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, the internet has become the place to go to for
     <strong>
      salvation
     </strong>
     . We've got used to searching for solutions online, and now these solutions even include how to fix or improve our lives. Interestingly,
     <strong>
      psychologist
     </strong>
     Caroline Beaton, says people called '
     <strong>
      millennials
     </strong>
     ' are
     <strong>
      self-critical
     </strong>
     – they are aware of their own faults – which also means they're more likely to spend time and money on self-help. There's also a theory that the self-help industry does well during a
     <strong>
      recession
     </strong>
     – people are perhaps even more likely to reach for self-help to improve their situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever the reason for the continued interest in self-help, it's good to know
     <strong>
      help is at hand
     </strong>
     when we need it. The alternative to finding a happier life is just to come to terms with yourself as you are – I know, I read about it in a book! Do you believe in self-help books?
