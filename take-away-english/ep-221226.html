      词汇：singing 唱歌
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether you love to
     <strong>
      belt out tunes
     </strong>
     at
     <strong>
      karaoke
     </strong>
     or just
     <strong>
      sing
     </strong>
     in the shower, it turns out that singing can be good for both physical and mental health. And you don't even have to be good at it!
    </p>
    <p>
     The physical and mental advantages of singing are caused by a combination of factors, according to Baishali Mukherjee from the World Federation of Music Therapy. He told BBC Future, "The physical
     <strong>
      exertion
     </strong>
     involved in singing – filling of our lungs, the firm control of our
     <strong>
      vocal cords
     </strong>
     , the movements of our mouth and body – is among the reasons why it can boost our mood."
     <strong>
      H
     </strong>
     <strong>
      itting all the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      notes
     </strong>
     involves
     <strong>
      breathing control
     </strong>
     and the use of the
     <strong>
      diaphragm
     </strong>
     . This can lead to an increase of oxygen intake and lung capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Also, apparently, singing in a group brings just as many benefits as
     <strong>
      singing
     </strong>
     <strong>
      solo
     </strong>
     . It has been estimated that over 2.2 million people in Britain now regularly sing in a
     <strong>
      choir
     </strong>
     . A choir can be
     <strong>
      amateur
     </strong>
     or professional and is made up of people who sing together, often
     <strong>
      in
     </strong>
     <strong>
      harmony
     </strong>
     with different people singing different parts, such as
     <strong>
      soprano
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      tenor
     </strong>
     , according to their
     <strong>
      vocal range
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A 2022 University of Vienna study found that
     <strong>
      choral
     </strong>
     singing enhances feelings of trust and bonding among a group, which can help with depression and loneliness. And, aside from mood-boosting, other proven mental health benefits of singing include a lowering of stress and anxiety levels due to the release of endorphins – the so-called 'happy hormones'.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, whether you are a confident
     <strong>
      vocalist
     </strong>
     or not, give singing a go! You don't need an
     <strong>
      instrument
     </strong>
     because that's you. And yes, you might forget the
     <strong>
      lyrics
     </strong>
     or sound a little
     <strong>
      out of tune
     </strong>
     , but remember, there are a wealth of positives.
