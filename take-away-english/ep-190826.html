     I love holidays! There’s nothing better than
     <strong>
      jetting off
     </strong>
     to a foreign destination to visit the
     <strong>
      attractions
     </strong>
     it has on offer. Of course, I’m not alone. Millions of people are doing the same, and why not? The world has an amazing variety of
     <strong>
      must-see sights
     </strong>
     , from
     <strong>
      breathtaking
     </strong>
     natural scenery to impressive old cities. But the problem is that too many of us are visiting them at the same time, putting pressure on these delicate and
     <strong>
      ancient
     </strong>
     places.
    </p>
    <p>
     That’s why a number of
     <strong>
      beauty spots
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      historic sites
     </strong>
     have been introducing
     <strong>
      charges
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      restrictions
     </strong>
     on the tourists who visit. There are many reasons for this: to reduce
     <strong>
      overcrowding
     </strong>
     , which can spoil the ambience of a place, to manage
     <strong>
      wear and tear
     </strong>
     on old crumbling buildings, to tidy up the mess that visitors leave behind, or – as some may suggest – creating
     <strong>
      tourist traps
     </strong>
     to make more money out of the visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
     The famous Italian city of Venice with its
     <strong>
      picturesque
     </strong>
     canals has, for example, introduced an entry fee of up to €10 for
     <strong>
      short-stay
     </strong>
     tourists. Venetians have long complained that
     <strong>
      mass tourism
     </strong>
     is swamping the city. Now, passengers arriving by cruise ship will have to pay a ‘
     <strong>
      landing tax
     </strong>
     ’ which Mayor Luigi Brugnaro says, “would generate much-needed income to keep the city clean.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Many cities in Europe already charge an
     <strong>
      occupancy tax
     </strong>
     on tourists who stay in hotels and guest houses. In the UK, Edinburgh is hoping to do the same, controversially making it the first city in the country to do so. This
     <strong>
      levy
     </strong>
     , that is usually charged per person per night of
     <strong>
      accommodation
     </strong>
     , raises money to help protect the environment, pay for
     <strong>
      infrastructure
     </strong>
     , or promote tourism.
    </p>
    <p>
     In Italy’s capital city, Rome, new laws are being introduced to clamp down on bad tourist behaviour, which some argue is spoiling the look and feel of the city. Rules include banning drinking water from fountains and attaching ‘
     <strong>
      love padlocks
     </strong>
     ’ to bridges.
    </p>
    <p>
     As more of us can now afford to travel, tourist destinations are going to get busier, so maybe new laws and taxes are going to be a necessary part of the
     <strong>
      sightseeing
     </strong>
     experience.
