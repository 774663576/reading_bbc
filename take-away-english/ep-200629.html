     你是否曾经为了升学考试或者工作中的一个项目长期加班加点、顶着压力努力拼搏？等到结束后，感到身心疲惫？这就被称为 “burnout（过度疲劳）”。本文讨论如何在生活和工作中避免过度疲劳。

      词汇：burnout 过度疲劳

     Whether it’s studying for exams, working on a project or struggling with a dissertation, we’ve all been under immense
     <strong>
      stress
     </strong>
     at some point. When it gets a bit
     <strong>
      overwhelming
     </strong>
     , we can reach a level of exhaustion that is
     <strong>
      unprecedented
     </strong>
     – the
     <strong>
      dreaded
     </strong>
     burnout. However, that feeling of exhaustion is not just physical; it can be mental as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to ‘Psychology Today’, burnout isn’t just caused by working long hours; it is more about
     <strong>
      prolonged
     </strong>
     or repeated exposure to a stressful situation. The result can be feelings of
     <strong>
      cynicism
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      depression
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      lethargy
     </strong>
     . A feeling of loss of control in a work scenario can create a conflict with the
     <strong>
      sense of self
     </strong>
     – which can lead to burnout. Suffering from burnout can
     <strong>
      stifle
     </strong>
     our creativity and productivity. Ironically, this means that
     <strong>
      striving
     </strong>
     to be more efficient can result in a reduction in our productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what can we do to avoid the evils of burnout? Well, there are some tips that may help you. Psychologist Albert Bandura’s idea of
     <strong>
      self-efficacy
     </strong>
     – which is the theory that you should believe in your ability to complete a task at hand - may assist you. A feeling that the task is
     <strong>
      achievable
     </strong>
     and that you are
     <strong>
      capable
     </strong>
     of succeeding means that a difficult task might be less
     <strong>
      gruelling
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding ways to express your creative side may help. Not everyone has creative aspects to their jobs, and, therefore, they need to find other
     <strong>
      outlets
     </strong>
     . They could paint, write or take part in local theatre. All of this may help to detach them from the overwhelming stress that may exist in their working life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking after yourself and your surroundings can also be
     <strong>
      beneficial
     </strong>
     . The consequence is that you are surrounded by a cleaner and more positive environment. This, in turn, leads to another tip, which is to have healthy and positive thoughts. Being negative can be incredibly
     <strong>
      draining
     </strong>
     . Having a
     <strong>
      positive mental attitude
     </strong>
     towards everything you do means that you may feel more capable as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     Burnout is a common condition associated with the pressures of the modern world. It’s not just a physical condition; it has psychological effects that can impact heavily on your work and life in general. Taking steps to avoid burning out can benefit not just us, but our bosses and families.
