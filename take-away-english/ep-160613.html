     You're learning English, right? You might think you can work out the
     <strong>
      grammar
     </strong>
     and have built a vast
     <strong>
      vocabulary
     </strong>
     , but then you come across an expression like 'plos'. According to online
     <strong>
      urban slang
     </strong>
     dictionaries, it means 'parents looking over shoulder'. Teenagers are to blame. They have their own
     <strong>
      code
     </strong>
     , including 'text speak' when they are on the internet or using their phones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Text speak has a lot to do with inventing
     <strong>
      cool
     </strong>
     new
     <strong>
      terms
     </strong>
     – and these change quickly. Maybe you shouldn't be surprised if an English friend says you sound a bit
     <strong>
      old-fashioned
     </strong>
     . The
     <strong>
      modal verb
     </strong>
     'shall' is
     <strong>
      on the way out
     </strong>
     because 'will' sounds more natural these days. Bas Aarts, Professor of English
     <strong>
      linguistics
     </strong>
     at University College London says, "If you have two words which more or less express the same meaning, one of the two words will get pushed out of the language."
    </p>
    <p>
     People have been
     <strong>
      shying away from
     </strong>
     using the modal 'must' because it sounds
     <strong>
      authoritarian
     </strong>
     and people are choosing to express obligation in different ways. It sounds nicer to soften
     <strong>
      obligation
     </strong>
     by saying 'might'. For example, "You might like to read this article."
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Progressive tenses
     </strong>
     - formed from the verb 'be' and the
     <strong>
      suffix
     </strong>
     'ing' - are used for ongoing situations, for example, 'I'm writing this article for you to read'. But its use has been increasing rapidly. Bas Aarts says that this might have to do with
     <strong>
      advertising
     </strong>
     . A fast-food chain uses the expression 'I'm loving it' in English-speaking countries. But the verb 'love' expresses a state of being – as opposed to doing – and is usually used in the simple form, for example, 'I love it'. These days, people are using
     <strong>
      stative verbs
     </strong>
     in the progressive more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before you despair and throw your English book in the bin, be assured that some words take a very long time to change. According to Professor Mark Pagel at Reading University in the UK,
     <strong>
      pronouns
     </strong>
     like 'I', 'you' and 'we' evolve slowly – a thousand years ago we would be using similar or sometimes identical sounds.
     <strong>
      Nouns
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      adjectives
     </strong>
     , on the other hand, get replaced rapidly – and in 500 years or so we'll probably be using different words to the ones we have now. But let's leave the problem for the future generations.

    </p>
    <p>
     1. Why are teenagers helping to change language?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because they tend to develop their own code to talk to each other (and not be understood by their parents).
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2.  Why might an English-speaking person think a non-native speaker of English sounds old-fashioned?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because language has been changing quickly and some words disappear and are replaced by new ones.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3.  Why is the word 'might' often used to replace the word 'must'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The word 'might' sounds nicer than the word 'must' when you want to express obligation but sound less authoritarian.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4.  What has been interfering with the way grammar is used?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Advertising.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5.
     <strong>
     </strong>
     Which word is likely to change faster: 'likable' or 'they'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      'Likable' because it is an adjective while 'they' is a pronoun. According to Professor Mark Pagel at Reading University in the UK, adjectives and nouns are likely to be replaced faster.
     </strong>
