     Do you take care about what you wear? Some people are very
     <strong>
      fashion-conscious
     </strong>
     , carefully selecting the clothes they buy and how they dress.
     <strong>
      Fashionistas
     </strong>
     always want to be seen in the latest
     <strong>
      designer
     </strong>
     <strong>
      gear
     </strong>
     . But that trend is changing as
     <strong>
      retro
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      vintage
     </strong>
     clothing is becoming a popular and often cheaper alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, ‘vintage’ clothing is really
     <strong>
      second-hand
     </strong>
     clothing, worn before but given
     <strong>
      a new lease of life
     </strong>
     . The fashion industry has
     <strong>
      rebranded
     </strong>
     this stuff to make it look
     <strong>
      trendy
     </strong>
     and possibly give it a higher
     <strong>
      price tag
     </strong>
     . Whereas we may have seen an old
     <strong>
      faded
     </strong>
     pair of jeans or a
     <strong>
      gingham-patterned
     </strong>
     dress sold at a jumble sale, now there are
     <strong>
      boutique
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      pop-up shops
     </strong>
     dedicated to the stuff. And in the UK, one supermarket chain has started selling second-hand clothes in some of its stores under the brand, Preloved Vintage Wholesale. Its managing director Steve Lynam told the BBC:  “The more people that buy into the
     <strong>
      circular economy
     </strong>
     and shop vintage and retro, the bigger impact we will have on climate change.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Certainly, buying vintage does prolong the life of clothing. It cuts down on waste and helps to reduce the environmental damage caused by
     <strong>
      manufacturing
     </strong>
     new clothes. It’s also led to the rise of retro-fashion – items that your mum or dad wore decades ago that now look ‘cool’ again! It’s a big thing with younger people and has been helped by the rise of platforms like Depop and Vinted, which sell ‘worn’ clothes online. Ianina Lucca from Depop told the BBC: “The new generation is… looking to make choices that reduce their impact on the environment, with 77% of Gen Z saying that their biggest environmental concern being that they want their choices to reduce waste.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Another popular way of buying old clothes is in a vintage kilo sale. People pick what they want and then pay according to weight rather than per item. Some items are
     <strong>
      upcycled
     </strong>
     – re-modelled or re-worked by adding
     <strong>
      embroidery
     </strong>
     , patches and other additions. But however these second-hand clothes are worn or re-designed, the
     <strong>
      sustainability
     </strong>
     of vintage fashion means it’s here to stay for some time to come.
