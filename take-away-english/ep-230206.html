     For many of us, our closest
     <strong>
      encounter
     </strong>
     with wild animals is at a zoo. These places allow us to observe the behaviours and characteristics of amazing
     <strong>
      creatures
     </strong>
     from
     <strong>
      big cats
     </strong>
     to tiny
     <strong>
      amphibians
     </strong>
     . It's an enjoyable and educational experience for us, but is it the best
     <strong>
      environment
     </strong>
     for the animals?
    </p>
    <p>
     A long time ago, people could only see wild animals as
     <strong>
      stuffed
     </strong>
     dead exhibits in a museum. Later, live animals were captured by explorers, brought home and put on show to the public in
     <strong>
      menageries
     </strong>
     –
     <strong>
      animal welfare
     </strong>
     was not a priority. But modern zoos and
     <strong>
      wildlife parks
     </strong>
     have transformed the conditions and environments for animals, making bigger
     <strong>
      enclosures
     </strong>
     , removing bars, and, to some extent, mimicking their
     <strong>
      natural habitats
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people have questioned the cruelty of keeping animals
     <strong>
      captive
     </strong>
     and using them just for entertainment, but zoos are keen to show they are here to help wildlife by educating us about
     <strong>
      conservation
     </strong>
     . In the UK, the introduction of The Zoo Licensing Act 1981 also required zoos to educate the public. Well-managed zoos are now also involved in supporting and
     <strong>
      funding
     </strong>
     conservation programmes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Probably the biggest claim from zoos today is that they help to protect
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     that are under threat
     <strong>
      in the wild
     </strong>
     due to climate change. Robert Young, Chair in Wildlife Conservation at Salford University says: "There are quite a lot of different species around the planet which we wouldn't have today if it wasn't for zoos." Some zoos have captive
     <strong>
      breeding
     </strong>
     programmes which help to preserve the future of species that would otherwise face
     <strong>
      extinction
     </strong>
     . Actor Leonardo DiCaprio recently praised Chester Zoo in the UK for its conservation work. It brought a "rare fish species back from the dead" after breeding and releasing a school of
     <strong>
      golden skiffia
     </strong>
     fish back into their
     <strong>
      native
     </strong>
     river.
    </p>
    <p>
     While the debate about having zoos continues, new opportunities to meet wildlife are being explored, such as using virtual reality, and Jon Coe, a zoo designer, told the BBC: "Taking a walk through a
     <strong>
      herd
     </strong>
     of elephants in the Serengeti, I think, is going to be possible pretty soon."
