     How are you feeling today? I've got a few aches and pains, but nothing serious. However, when things become more
     <strong>
      critical,
     </strong>
     I would normally book myself an
     <strong>
      appointment
     </strong>
     with my
     <strong>
      GP
     </strong>
     – although by the time I get to see him, the problem will have probably gone away. That's because in the UK at least, we usually have to wait a few days before the doctor can fit us in, and then when we're at the
     <strong>
      surgery
     </strong>
     , we have a long wait.
    </p>
    <p>
     Luckily today, technology has
     <strong>
      come to our rescue
     </strong>
     . There are thousands of apps available on our smartphones that can offer first aid advice and allow us to
     <strong>
      self-diagnose
     </strong>
     our
     <strong>
      ailments
     </strong>
     – ranging from a simple cold or flu to some exotic disease such as
     <strong>
      dengue fever
     </strong>
     . And together with the internet, we have a whole encylopedia of medical information
     <strong>
      at our fingertips
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But is this
     <strong>
      just what the doctor ordered
     </strong>
     ? Is too much knowledge a good thing? By reading up on an illness, we discover its
     <strong>
      side-effects
     </strong>
     and what could happen in a
     <strong>
      worst-case
     </strong>
     situation. More worrying is that we give ourselves the wrong diagnosis, and then worry ourselves sick that we're going to die. This health
     <strong>
      anxiety,
     </strong>
     fuelled by the internet, is called
     <strong>
      cyberchondria
     </strong>
     . It gives sufferers a deep
     <strong>
      fear
     </strong>
     of diseases and, according to experts, it's on the rise. Professor Peter Tyrer from Imperial College London, told the BBC: "We find that approximately four out of five of our patients with health anxiety spend literally hours on the internet…. one of the first things we do in
     <strong>
      treatment
     </strong>
     is we tell them to stop browsing the internet."
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course there is no doubt, the world wide web has most of the information we need to diagnose our
     <strong>
      symptoms
     </strong>
     but Doctor Tyrer points out "it doesn't have any judgement associated with it." This is why having a
     <strong>
      consultation
     </strong>
     with a doctor face-to-face still has its benefits, although a study a few years ago found many GPs felt
     <strong>
      intimidated
     </strong>
     by the increasing numbers of web-wise patients arriving in surgeries. One doctor admitted to not being very happy about patients using the internet, saying: "They all seemed to come to me with things I'd never heard of and very often with things which seem rather
     <strong>
      bizarre
     </strong>
     or inappropriate."
    </p>
    <p>
     But Professor Sue Ziebland, from Oxford University, has spent 15 years examining how patients use the internet – including people with cancer. She found that doctors now routinely discuss it as a resource with patients during consultations so it becomes an everyday part of medical conversation. It would seem then that a virtual online doctor can
     <strong>
      prescribe
     </strong>
     a
     <strong>
      dose
     </strong>
     of useful advice, but technology hasn't replaced the human medical expert just yet.
