      Do you usually
      <strong>
       go dutch
      </strong>
      when you take someone out to dinner? Do you expect your
      <strong>
       date
      </strong>
      to pay for the whole meal?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Many people say that as long as there's love, money doesn't matter much. But this might change when the relationship gets serious and it can involve
      <strong>
       mortgages
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       joint current accounts
      </strong>
      and
      <strong>
       debt
      </strong>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A survey in the UK suggested that 44% of married couples don't know exactly what their
      <strong>
       spouse
      </strong>
      earns. The research, conducted by a UK
      <strong>
       credit report service
      </strong>
      also found that an
      <strong>
       astonishing
      </strong>
      1.9 million married couples actively try to keep their finances secret from their partners.

      British
      <strong>
       relationship therapist
      </strong>
      Arabella Russell says: "It’s very difficult to talk about money. Often there’s guilt, there’s shame. To start those conversations is complicated. Money can be about how we value ourselves, how we feel valued. It’s not just a simple case of talking about
      <strong>
       hard cash
      </strong>
      ."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      So if you are in a couple, it might be a good idea to check if you both
      <strong>
       are on the same page
      </strong>
      about money before
      <strong>
       bills
      </strong>
      pile up on the kitchen table and love flies out of the window. When moving in together, couples should not only talk about their personal habits but also about their financial ones.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Arabella Russell has a word of advice: "Accept the fact that in your relationship you might do money differently – there might be a
      <strong>
       spender
      </strong>
      there might be a
      <strong>
       saver
      </strong>
      . It’s very tempting if your partner does things differently to say they’re wrong. Do it differently but have a
      <strong>
       budget
      </strong>
      ."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And now, back to that date… Would you be
      <strong>
       put off
      </strong>
      by someone who was attractive but expected you to pay the bill by yourself? There's
