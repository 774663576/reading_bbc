     How
     <strong>
      bored
     </strong>
     are you? Having nothing to do, or doing the same task again and again, can certainly be
     <strong>
      demotivating
     </strong>
     . And if
     <strong>
      boredom
     </strong>
     persists, you can lose your
     <strong>
      lust for life
     </strong>
     , and it can even affect your mental health. But does being bored have to be
     <strong>
      boring
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     A lack of
     <strong>
      stimulation
     </strong>
     can lead to boredom – this is when we start to
     <strong>
      yawn
     </strong>
     and our mind
     <strong>
      wanders
     </strong>
     . It can happen at home or at school, but it’s at work where some experts think being
     <strong>
      chronically
     </strong>
     bored can have damaging consequences. This situation has been termed ‘
     <strong>
      boreout
     </strong>
     ’ and is the opposite of ‘
     <strong>
      burnout
     </strong>
     ’. Writing for BBC Worklife, Bryan Lufkin says this happens “when we are bored by our work to the point that we feel it is totally
     <strong>
      meaningless
     </strong>
     . Our job seems
     <strong>
      pointless
     </strong>
     , our tasks devoid of value.” It can be caused by working in a
     <strong>
      demoralising
     </strong>
     physical environment or feeling
     <strong>
      under-challenged
     </strong>
     . Studies show depression from boreout can affect workers outside the office and lead to physical ailments from
     <strong>
      insomnia
     </strong>
     to headaches. But Bryan adds that “being able to identify it in us, is critical for tackling it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When it becomes
     <strong>
      mind-numbing
     </strong>
     and extreme, some people joke about ‘
     <strong>
      dying of boredom
     </strong>
     ’. According to Luis Villazon, writing for the Science Focus website, boredom is just a
     <strong>
      state of mind
     </strong>
     which won’t kill you, though it can depress the
     <strong>
      immune system
     </strong>
     in some people. He says “The greatest risk from boredom stems from the things you do to combat it. People who are easily bored are more likely to engage in dangerous sports [...]”, for example. But some experts say boredom is a natural thing and it should be seen in a more positive light. If we see it as an opportunity, it could ignite our creativity. And if our boredom is at work, it could force us to engage with mentors, career counsellors or even our bosses. And Lotta Harju from EM Lyon Business School told the BBC, “boreout can mark a
     <strong>
      transition
     </strong>
     into something else: a different career entirely, or a different role in the organisation. If people only take its cue.”

     1. What two reasons are given that work might cause someone to develop boreout?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      We can develop boreout if our job seems meaningless or pointless.

    <p>
     2. How can extreme boredom at work affect us outside the office?
