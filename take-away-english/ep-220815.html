     The
     <strong>
      destructive
     </strong>
     <strong>
      impact
     </strong>
     of fast fashion
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     the environment is widely documented. So how can we, as
     <strong>
      consumers
     </strong>
     , reduce our
     <strong>
      fashion footprint
     </strong>
     ? One obvious answer is to buy less. Another is to buy clothes that have been more
     <strong>
      sustainably
     </strong>
     made, using organic and recycled materials.
     <strong>
      Hiring
     </strong>
     clothes is another way to get new pieces for our
     <strong>
      wardrobe
     </strong>
     . But buying second-hand may be the simplest solution and a
     <strong>
      trend
     </strong>
     that is growing fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the Boston Consulting Group, second-hand clothes are
     <strong>
      projected
     </strong>
     to make up 27 per cent of customers’ wardrobes by 2023. By 2030, the second-hand clothing market is projected to be twice the size of
     <strong>
      fast fashion
     </strong>
     , according to a global report by Thredup and GlobalData. So, it seems, the next ten years will see the
     <strong>
      resale market
     </strong>
     grow fast, and this is in part because we now have more options than simply buying from
     <strong>
      charity shops
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      jumble sales
     </strong>
     . Online sites are making it easier to both buy and sell
     <strong>
      pre-loved
     </strong>
     <strong>
      items
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It also helps that the perception of pre-loved clothing has changed. Dr Amna Khan, senior lecturer in consumer behaviours and
     <strong>
      retail
     </strong>
     at Manchester Metropolitan University, said ‘it’s now become
     <strong>
      trendy
     </strong>
     to wear second-hand’ and it’s no longer ‘a case of only buying it if you can’t afford anything else’. The changing
     <strong>
      values
     </strong>
     of shoppers is even being seen in
     <strong>
      celebrity culture
     </strong>
     , with television personalities, such as contestants on the popular UK TV show Love Island, promoting second-hand clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not everyone is convinced that these changes in shopping habits will do enough to reduce our fashion footprint. The charity Wrap tells people to
     <strong>
      repair
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      revamp
     </strong>
     clothes they already have in their wardrobe before buying new ones, even if they are second-hand. But it’s clear that some consumers now want to consume less and make more environmentally friendly choices when they do buy. The fashion industry is therefore having to change, and the second-hand market is the star of the show.
