      词汇: study 学习

    <p>
     So, it's exam time again – have you done the necessary work to get good
     <strong>
      marks
     </strong>
     ? Sleeping with the
     <strong>
      textbook
     </strong>
     under the pillow in the hope that knowledge will be magically absorbed into your brain as you sleep doesn't work. The best
     <strong>
      strategy
     </strong>
     is to
     <strong>
      space your practice out
     </strong>
     , rather than
     <strong>
      cram
     </strong>
     it all together. It means
     <strong>
      hit the books
     </strong>
     early!
    </p>
    <p>
     In an article in the British newspaper The Guardian, Tom Stafford, a
     <strong>
      lecturer
     </strong>
     in psychology and
     <strong>
      cognitive science
     </strong>
     at the University of Sheffield, UK, advises: "If you organise five hours of study into one hour a day, you'll remember more than if you study for five hours on one day."
    </p>
    <p>
     Don't rely on memory alone – get pen and paper and start working. Students who can test themselves in advance will be better at
     <strong>
      retrieving
     </strong>
     material from their memory and learn that material in the long run. John Dunlosky, Professor of Psychology at Kent State University in the US, suggests that "you start by reading a textbook using your favourite
     <strong>
      highlighter
     </strong>
     and favourite colours, but then you go back and make
     <strong>
      flashcards
     </strong>
     of all the
     <strong>
      critical concepts
     </strong>
     and instead of just rereading those, you basically try to test yourselves on them."
    </p>
    <p>
     Good revision should give you confidence, but if you are still anxious, there's no harm in indulging in a personal
     <strong>
      ritual
     </strong>
     . In Japan, it seems to be a tradition for students to eat Katsudon before a test. This is a warm bowl of rice topped with egg and a deep-fried pork cutlet. The name of the dish reminds people of the word 'katsu', meaning 'winning'.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some students in South Korea, the key to success is not washing their hair before
     <strong>
      sitting an exam
     </strong>
     because they believe they could wash all the knowledge out of their head. And in different parts of the world there are always those who swear by their 'lucky underwear'.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bottom line is that you need to study, sleep well on the eve of the test, eat a
     <strong>
      nutritious
     </strong>
     meal, drink plenty of water and believe that your efforts will
     <strong>
      pay off
     </strong>
     . Good luck in your exam!
