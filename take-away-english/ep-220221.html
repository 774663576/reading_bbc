     Are you
     <strong>
      good with your hands
     </strong>
     ? Many of us like to make things which we can use or give as gifts.
     <strong>
      Crafting
     </strong>
     is certainly a
     <strong>
      hobby
     </strong>
     that’s seen a resurgence, and those who pursue it claim getting
     <strong>
      creative
     </strong>
     improves their mood.
    </p>
    <p>
     The recent lockdowns caused by the Covid pandemic gave people time at home to try out new activities, which they’ve continued to enjoy. Many turned to hobbies such as
     <strong>
      craft making
     </strong>
     as a way to soothe their work-from-home burnout.
     <strong>
      Knitting
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      crocheting
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      pottery
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      painting
     </strong>
     are all crafts that have seen a
     <strong>
      revival
     </strong>
     , and many of them are being done by younger people.
    </p>
    <p>
     But even before the pandemic, people were turning to
     <strong>
      arts and crafts
     </strong>
     as an interesting
     <strong>
      pastime
     </strong>
     and even a way to make a bit of pocket money. Numerous websites, such as Etsy and Folksy, allowed people to sell their
     <strong>
      handmade
     </strong>
     goods. Richard Sennett, author of the Craftsman, told the BBC that: “A lot of people are finding their day jobs pretty empty, whereas learning a craft provides a real
     <strong>
      satisfaction
     </strong>
     . It’s a skill – things like
     <strong>
      carpentry
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      weaving
     </strong>
     are mentally and physically stimulating, and people get inherent pleasure out of that kind of work”.
    </p>
    <p>
     The internet has also been the place to turn to to buy
     <strong>
      craft kits
     </strong>
     which help you get started with your craft-making projects, such as
     <strong>
      candle making
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      macrame.
     </strong>
     But many people are enjoying designing and making things
     <strong>
      from scratch
     </strong>
     and are doing it just for pleasure or to occupy their minds – and there’s evidence that it’s good for us as well. According to research commissioned by BBC Arts, even the briefest time spent on a creative pastime such as painting, pottery or playing the piano, has an impact on our wellbeing and emotions. The survey of around 50,000 people found being creative can help avoid stress, free up mind space and improve self-development, which helps build self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you’re looking for the perfect tonic for your stressed-out life, maybe now’s the time to get creative.
