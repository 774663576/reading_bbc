     如何在餐馆或咖啡馆给小费是一个十分复杂的问题。小费应该是给现金还是在买单时一并用信用卡支付？你更愿意支付固定的服务费，还是认为付小费完全没有必要？“随身英语” 讨论这个让很多人都感到困惑而棘手的问题。

     It’s nice to go out for a meal at a restaurant. But what makes it extra special – apart from the food - is to receive
     <strong>
      attentive
     </strong>
     service from the staff. What can leave
     <strong>
      a bad taste in your mouth
     </strong>
     , though,is to be handed the
     <strong>
      bill
     </strong>
     and see that a
     <strong>
      service charge
     </strong>
     has been added. You’re faced with the dilemma of deciding to pay it, and whether you should add a
     <strong>
      tip
     </strong>
     on top.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Putting your hand in your pocket
     </strong>
     to reward good service is a personal choice, but it also depends on where you are in the world. What is
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      norm
     </strong>
     in one city is not necessarily the norm in another. In some places a tip is expected; but in others, good service should be
     <strong>
      expected
     </strong>
     and ought to be included in the price.
    </p>
    <p>
     Adding an
     <strong>
      optional
     </strong>
     service charge to your bill certainly makes paying a tip less awkward because there’s no need to calculate the amount. But even though it’s not
     <strong>
      compulsory
     </strong>
     , you sometimes feel
     <strong>
      obliged
     </strong>
     to pay it. In the UK, where people tend to be too polite to complain, they might pay the service charge despite quietly complaining that the service they received was not
     <strong>
      up to scratch
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     Choosing your own amount
     <strong>
      to tip
     </strong>
     may seem fairer, but should you pay it in cash or add it on to a credit card payment? And who will be the
     <strong>
      recipient
     </strong>
     ? If we are to pay extra, we want to know it goes to the person who deserves it and that it’s not used as an alternative to paying someone a proper
     <strong>
      wage
     </strong>
     . In the UK in 2009, the law was changed after an outcry over staff being paid under
     <strong>
      the minimum wage
     </strong>
     and then topping up their wages with money they had earned in tips.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, in the US it’s still customary to leave a
     <strong>
      gratuity
     </strong>
     because tips often make up a substantial part of a
     <strong>
      server
     </strong>
     ’s
     <strong>
      income
     </strong>
     . Restaurant owner William Beckett told the BBC that in New York, for example, “There’s a
     <strong>
      tacit pressure
     </strong>
     to tip. But theoretically you (could) just stand up and walk out. You don’t. Everybody tips 20%.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe we should follow Japan’s approach, where tipping under any circumstance may seem rude because good service is standard and expected. Elsewhere, there are calls for restaurants to replace the tipping system with a so-called '
     <strong>
      hospitality-included
     </strong>
     ' charge – a single payment which covers both the meal and the service. This basically means, don’t tip - the price you see on the menu reflects the full cost of dining. That might make receiving the final bill easier to swallow!
