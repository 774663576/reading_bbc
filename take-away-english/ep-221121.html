     几个世纪以来，人类一直试图控制天气。比如，人们认为人工降雨可以带来好处。本文探讨我们是否可以通过人工手段控制天气。

     The weather affects all of us. An unexpected
     <strong>
      downpour
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      hot
     </strong>
     <strong>
      spell
     </strong>
     can be annoying, but when conditions are more
     <strong>
      extreme
     </strong>
     , it can severely impact agriculture, transport infrastructure and our homes. It's no surprise that for centuries scientists have tried to control the weather – but is it really possible?
    </p>
    <p>
     Due to
     <strong>
      climate change
     </strong>
     , there are more regular occurrences of
     <strong>
      heatwaves
     </strong>
     , which cause
     <strong>
      droughts
     </strong>
     , and
     <strong>
      torrential rain
     </strong>
     , which is responsible for
     <strong>
      flooding
     </strong>
     . Although humans are the cause of much of it, maybe we have a solution too? For example, China, the UAE and the USA are at the forefront of research into methods of producing rain in
     <strong>
      drought-stricken
     </strong>
     areas. And some scientists are even thinking about investigating technologies which could
     <strong>
      cool
     </strong>
     the entire planet.
    </p>
    <p>
     It might sound like science fiction, but
     <strong>
      weather modification
     </strong>
     is nothing new. In the 1940s, scientists discovered that dropping particles of
     <strong>
      silver iodide
     </strong>
     into cloud tops, made the tiny water droplets
     <strong>
      condense
     </strong>
     and could stimulate
     <strong>
      precipitation
     </strong>
     . That's called
     <strong>
      cloud seeding
     </strong>
     . This is a technique still being tested today with the aim of producing extra
     <strong>
      rainfall
     </strong>
     and, therefore, water for drought-affected farmers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other ideas for keeping nature at bay include using lasers to generate clouds and for controlling
     <strong>
      thunderstorms
     </strong>
     . One idea involved firing laser pulses into
     <strong>
      thunderclouds
     </strong>
     in an attempt to suck out
     <strong>
      lightning
     </strong>
     in a controlled manner. This was unsuccessful. New research into
     <strong>
      solar geoengineering
     </strong>
     has also begun. This type of climate engineering involves
     <strong>
      sunlight
     </strong>
     being reflected back to space to limit or reverse human-caused climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite all this ongoing research, there's no conclusive evidence that our weather can be controlled. Chris Bell, a lecturer in
     <strong>
      meteorology
     </strong>
     at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Future: "We may, one day, have the technology to control the weather, but it will be in thousands, not hundreds, of years." So, for now, we still need to rely on
     <strong>
      Mother Nature
     </strong>
     to control our weather.
