    <p>
     As a dog lover, our
     <strong>
      canine
     </strong>
     companions always fill me with joy. Whether
     <strong>
      pedigree
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      mongrel
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      tame
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      stray
     </strong>
     , whenever I see one, I smile. After all, their loyalty is indisputable, their
     <strong>
      companionship
     </strong>
     is always welcome, they
     <strong>
      fetch
     </strong>
     for us,
     <strong>
      guard
     </strong>
     for us and even work for us when required. Good old
     <strong>
      Fido
     </strong>
     has always been
     <strong>
      close to my, and many other’s hearts
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, not content with just
     <strong>
      warming the cockles of your heart
     </strong>
     , it seems that our four-legged-friends actually lower the risk of
     <strong>
      cardiovascular
     </strong>
     disease, according to a 2017 scientific study, which looked at 3.4 million Swedes from 2001 to 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
     The study concluded that this lower risk, which was particularly evident in owners of hunting
     <strong>
      breeds
     </strong>
     , may not just be due to the increased
     <strong>
      physical activity
     </strong>
     that goes hand-in-hand with owning a dog, but could also be down to dogs increasing the owner’s
     <strong>
      social contact
     </strong>
     , or by changing the owner's
     <strong>
      bacterial microbiome
     </strong>
     , which is the collection of microscopic species that live in the
     <strong>
      gut
     </strong>
     . Dogs change the dirt in home environments and therefore expose people to bacteria that they would otherwise not encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
     These effects were particularly marked in those who lived
     <strong>
      on their lonesome
     </strong>
     . According to Mwenya Mubanga of Uppsala University and lead author of the study, “single dog owners had a 33% reduction in risk of death and an 11% reduction in risk of
     <strong>
      cardiac arrest
     </strong>
     compared to single non-owners.”
    </p>
    <p>
     However, before
     <strong>
      your heart skips a beat
     </strong>
     , Tove Fall, senior author of the study, also adds that there may be limitations. It’s possible that the differences between owners and non-owners, which already existed before the dog was bought, could have influenced the results – or that people who are generally more active also tend to get a dog anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems that the results are not as clear cut as they initially appear to be, but as far as I’m concerned, that’s ok. I love dogs for how they make me feel and, cardiovascular benefits or not, they’ll always be
     <strong>
      top dog
     </strong>
     to me –
     <strong>
      cross my heart
     </strong>
     .
