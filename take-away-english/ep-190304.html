     “获奖的是……” 当颁奖嘉宾宣布奖项得主时，获奖者得在有限的时间内快速上台领奖，并说出自己的获奖感言。但在获奖后应该说什么才合适呢？各大电影及音乐颁奖典礼的主办方通常会给获奖者一个发表感言的机会：有人幽默风趣、风度翩翩；有人慷慨激昂、感情真挚；有人则可能因为准备不充分，在台上支支吾吾地说不出话来 — 不禁让人觉得有几分尴尬。《随身英语》介绍几个做公众演讲时值得参考的小贴士。

     <strong>
      Vocabulary:  public speaking 词汇: 公众演讲
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     'Thank you' is a very
     <strong>
      polite
     </strong>
     thing to say when you are given something, and this is particularly important when receiving an award at a
     <strong>
      prestigious
     </strong>
     ceremony. But if you're one of the lucky winners, 'thank you' is just the start of the most important acceptance speech of your life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Film, TV and music award ceremonies are all about the acceptance speeches – they are an
     <strong>
      art form
     </strong>
     in their own right. They are a chance for an actor or performer to publicly thank people who've helped them. In this year's BAFTAs, Letitia Wright even thanked God for her EE Rising Star award in an
     <strong>
      emotional
     </strong>
     acceptance speech.
    </p>
    <p>
     Speeches are also used as a platform to make a political statement or just to raise someone's
     <strong>
      profile
     </strong>
     – so it's important to get the words right. And these words have to be delivered in a short amount of time. For example, at this year's Oscars, nominees have only 90 seconds from finding out they've won to finishing their speech. John Bailey, president of the Academy, has told them they should "get up there and keep speeches
     <strong>
      brief
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     When the clock is ticking, it's hard to say everything you want.
     <strong>
      Weeping
     </strong>
     can waste time;
     <strong>
      bumbling
     </strong>
     costs valuable seconds. Experts in the field say it's important to be
     <strong>
      personable
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      heartfelt
     </strong>
     and to speak like you're talking to a friend. At the 2019 Golden Globes, Olivia Colman was named the best actress for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite and gave an
     <strong>
      endearingly
     </strong>
     excited speech that ended with her holding up her trophy and sending a message to her family: "Ed and the kids - look! Yay!"
    </p>
    <p>
     You would expect an actor to be
     <strong>
      eloquent
     </strong>
     and able to perform on stage in front of an audience. But for others, such as sports people, it can be more
     <strong>
      awkward
     </strong>
     . When Japan's Naomi Osaka won this year's Australian Open final, she said "Sorry,
     <strong>
      public speaking
     </strong>
     isn't my strong point so I hope I can get through this… I read notes before this but I still forgot what I was meant to say."
    </p>
    <p>
     Preparation is key. It's important to make notes that remind you to thank people, say some
     <strong>
      words of wisdom
     </strong>
     , and
     <strong>
      win over
     </strong>
     the audience. But if you've got nothing to say, accept your award
     <strong>
      graciously
     </strong>
     then get off stage before the music starts playing again – just remember to say 'thank you'!
