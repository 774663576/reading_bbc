     有很多关于改善睡眠质量和增加睡眠时间的观念是错误的，其中一些甚至会对人们的健康造成损害。坐在电视机前打盹，一直躺在床上以帮助睡眠……这些方式可能并不像你想象的那样有益处。本文介绍一些可以帮助你改善睡眠质量的方法，以及一些关于 “睡眠” 的词汇。

     Sleeping is important, but we all know that, right? Many people have experienced strange
     <strong>
      sleeping patterns
     </strong>
     , weird dreams and a feeling of
     <strong>
      restlessness
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      drowsiness
     </strong>
     during the coronavirus lockdown, despite a good night’s sleep. So what sort of things can help you to improve your sleep?
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a plethora of myths related to sleep, some of which can be quite damaging for our health. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously claimed that she only
     <strong>
      hit the sack
     </strong>
     for five hours a night. But according to experts this is detrimental to health. Likewise,
     <strong>
      kipping
     </strong>
     in front of the TV is another thing to avoid. The bright lights can prevent you from entering
     <strong>
      deep sleep.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     From a young age we're told to
     <strong>
      count sheep
     </strong>
     to help us to
     <strong>
      nod off
     </strong>
     , with some choosing to stay in bed to battle with
     <strong>
      insomnia
     </strong>
     . However, some experts advise getting up and doing something mindless, like folding socks, to help us get in the mood to
     <strong>
      catch forty winks.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Psychologist Seth J. Gillihan PhD recommends walking to help in the battle against insomnia. He talks about a sleep study published in the journal Sleep Health which suggests that those who walk slightly more will experience better quality and duration of sleep. Watching what you eat or drink can also improve the amount of
     <strong>
      REM
     </strong>
     , or
     <strong>
      rapid eye movement
     </strong>
     you experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're a
     <strong>
      snorer
     </strong>
     , you might also want to take note. While most snoring is harmless, it could be a sign of
     <strong>
      sleep
     </strong>
     <strong>
      apnoea
     </strong>
     , with people suffering from the condition more likely to have strokes or heart attacks, irregular heartbeats or high blood pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, a decent
     <strong>
      nap
     </strong>
     , or even a
     <strong>
      power nap
     </strong>
     , can help you to be more alert, calm and focussed. So while there are some good tips like exercising or folding socks to help us get
     <strong>
      a good night's sleep
     </strong>
     , sometimes a good afternoon's sleep can help us tackle the day ahead.
