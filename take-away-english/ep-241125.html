     “Wisdom” 是什么？也许你和许多人一样，觉得给智慧下一个简单、明确的定义并不容易。人们对智慧的定义五花八门，本文介绍一项覆盖五大洲 12 个国家的大型研究，这项研究探索了人们对智慧的不同观点和理解。

     Think of the wisest person you know. What is it that makes them wise? What
     <strong>
      qualities
     </strong>
     do they have? Does wisdom mean the same for you as it does for me? All cultures value wisdom, but not all cultures agree on its definition. For some, the focus is on intelligence, while others emphasise
     <strong>
      compassionate
     </strong>
     love for others. In some cultures, a
     <strong>
      spiritual
     </strong>
     component is required to be considered wise. Are there any aspects of wisdom that all cultures can agree on?
    </p>
    <p>
     A group of 34 researchers from all over the world and from fields like psychology, philosophy and
     <strong>
      anthropology
     </strong>
     got together to explore 'Dimensions of wisdom
     <strong>
      perception
     </strong>
     across twelve countries on five continents'. The study found two
     <strong>
      characteristics
     </strong>
     that everyone – from urban university students in Peru to villagers in rural India – associated with wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first quality a wise person must have is 'socio-emotional
     <strong>
      awareness
     </strong>
     '. This is about the ability to understand others'
     <strong>
      point of view
     </strong>
     and really care about their thoughts and feelings. However, this person must also have the second quality: '
     <strong>
      reflective
     </strong>
     orientation', which is about using
     <strong>
      logic
     </strong>
     and past experience to make
     <strong>
      judgements
     </strong>
     . If you are
     <strong>
      mindlessly
     </strong>
     driven by emotions and don't think before you act, then you are unlikely to be
     <strong>
      perceived
     </strong>
     as wise. So, if you want to be wise, learn to both
     <strong>
      keep your cool
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      put yourself in others' shoes
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But, while this study helps us build a more unified definition of wisdom, the world is vast and cultures vary hugely. In 'The Cambridge Handbook of Wisdom', the authors make an apple pie analogy, comparing pie to wisdom. Imagine your grandmother makes your favourite apple pie – she represents the wisdom you think is best. Now, imagine you take this apple pie to the Amazon rainforest, where apples don't grow. For the locals, the pie isn't as good as their own traditional desserts; they've grown up with different flavours and ingredients, just as different cultures have developed their own wisdom traditions. Ultimately, the way wisdom is experienced, shared, and valued depends on the cultural ingredients involved.
