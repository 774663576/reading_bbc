      English is full of colourful phrases to describe shyness. Someone
      <strong>
       timid
      </strong>
     </span>
     <span>
      might be called
     </span>
     <strong>
      <span>
       shrinking violet
      </span>
     </strong>
     <span>
      or a
     </span>
     <strong>
      <span>
       wallflower
      </span>
     </strong>
     <span>
      , while for especially nervous types we have the curious expression:
     </span>
     <strong>
      <span>
       they wouldn’t say boo to a goose
      </span>
     </strong>
     <span>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     None of these are traditionally seen as positive descriptions, even if you like geese. In a culture of
     <strong>
      go-getting
     </strong>
     high achievers, shy people don’t come first.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or that's what the
     <strong>
      self-help
     </strong>
     industry
     <strong>
      would have you believe
     </strong>
     . Bookshops are filled with weighty
     <strong>
      tomes
     </strong>
     that promise to help beat social fears and find success in life, love and business.
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is why one book, Shrinking Violets: A Field Guide to Shyness,
     <strong>
      bucks the trend
     </strong>
     . It
     <strong>
      made a splash
     </strong>
     across English-language media recently for its new take on
     <strong>
      bashfulness
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Author Joe Moran says that despite struggling with shyness and
     <strong>
      craving
     </strong>
     <strong>
      solitude
     </strong>
     all his life, being timid can also be "a
     <strong>
      gift
     </strong>
     ". Freed from the persistent
     <strong>
      urge
     </strong>
     to participate and compete in social situations, people are liberated to look at the world in new ways, and gain fresh insights.
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, many of the world's great thinkers and artists are
     <strong>
      introverts
     </strong>
     . Scientists Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein preferred their own company; actress Keira Knightley often finds herself
     <strong>
      tongue-tied
     </strong>
     at parties; and Harry Potter author JK Rowling claims she used to be too nervous to even borrow a pen – a
     <strong>
      reticence
     </strong>
     she says forced her to
     <strong>
      delve
     </strong>
     deep into the world of her imagination.
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Moran told BBC Future: "I think shyness probably does turn you into an amateur
     <strong>
      anthropologist
     </strong>
     , really – you are more likely to be an observer."
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while
     <strong>
      extroverts
     </strong>
     make all the noise, they don't necessarily have the best ideas.
     <span>
      <br/>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're shy, you've probably known this for a long time. You just don't shout about it.
