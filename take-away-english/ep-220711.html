     一般来说，任何一种阅读方式都会同时用到大脑的几个区域。读纸质书可以帮助你更好地记住信息，听有声读物可能会帮助你在听到叙述者的情绪时培养同理心。本文讨论看书和听书各自的优势。

     Picture yourself sitting at home in a quiet
     <strong>
      reading nook
     </strong>
     , ignoring the world around you,
     <strong>
      engrossed
     </strong>
     in a
     <strong>
      tale
     </strong>
     . You read the
     <strong>
      blurb
     </strong>
     , instantly became intrigued and now you’re in the middle of an absolute
     <strong>
      page-turner
     </strong>
     . But, there’s a hot debate – physical books vs.
     <strong>
      e-books
     </strong>
     vs.
     <strong>
      audiobooks
     </strong>
     . Does the device you’re using to read affect your reaction to the book?
    </p>
    <p>
     Generally, reading uses several areas of the brain. There’s
     <strong>
      attention span
     </strong>
     , reasoning, reading
     <strong>
      fluency
     </strong>
     , memory and language comprehension. Reading is known to strengthen communicative ability, vocabulary and increase
     <strong>
      emotional intelligence
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      social perception
     </strong>
     . So, whichever way you’re reading, there are definitely benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, let’s look at the pros to reading with your eyes – that’s physical books and e-books. They can help to
     <strong>
      retain
     </strong>
     information better. This is because when you can actually see the words, your
     <strong>
      attention is held
     </strong>
     more closely. Add to this the fact that with physical books you can go back and find any part you missed, especially if your mind
     <strong>
      wanders
     </strong>
     , which it likely will at some point or other.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other hand, there’s the audiobook. Headphones in, you’re switched off from life and the story really
     <strong>
      comes alive
     </strong>
     , almost like watching a film – in your head. From a scientific perspective, listening to an audiobook is likely to help you develop a greater sense of empathy as you hear the emotion of the
     <strong>
      narrator
     </strong>
     . We can more easily understand
     <strong>
      inflection
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      intonation
     </strong>
     . Hearing the story engages different parts of the brain, heightening the intensity and
     <strong>
      imagery
     </strong>
     , making you enjoy it more. Yet, going back to attention span, with an audiobook it’s true that it’s much harder to go back and listen again.
    </p>
    <p>
     All in all, it seems that there are advantages to both physical books and audiobooks. Perhaps, next time you find yourself
     <strong>
      browsing
     </strong>
     <strong>
      bookshop shelves
     </strong>
     , also consider the format. It may just change your whole
     <strong>
      literary
     </strong>
     experience.
