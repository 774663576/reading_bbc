     我们每个人的体内或多或少都含有 “永久化学物”，这些化学物质还会在人体内不断地积累。许多日常生活用品中都含有这种有害化学物质，比如不粘锅、防油食物包装、防水衣物。“永久化学物” 与很多严重疾病之间存在联系。本文介绍什么是永久性化学物、它的危害以及减少接触这种物质的方法。

    <p>
     Almost all of us have them in our body, they
     <strong>
      accumulate
     </strong>
     throughout our lives and they may be causing serious health conditions. They've been called 'forever chemicals', but what are they, where do they come from, and what can we do about them?
    </p>
    <p>
     'Forever chemicals' take their name from the fact that they contain fluorine-carbon
     <strong>
      bonds
     </strong>
     , and because they last, if not forever, for a very long time. These chemical bonds are incredibly difficult to
     <strong>
      break down
     </strong>
     , which means that
     <strong>
      contaminants
     </strong>
     from these chemicals
     <strong>
      build up
     </strong>
     over time in our environment. As well as in our bodies, they've been found in the soil and in drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
     While some have now been banned, these chemicals have been used in a wide range of
     <strong>
      consumer products
     </strong>
     . They have a
     <strong>
      repellent effect
     </strong>
     on oil and water and so have been used for
     <strong>
      stain-proofing
     </strong>
     furniture and carpets. Forever chemicals have been used to make
     <strong>
      non-stick
     </strong>
     pans and
     <strong>
      grease-proof
     </strong>
     food packaging. You can find them in
     <strong>
      waterproof
     </strong>
     clothing and bicycle
     <strong>
      lubricants
     </strong>
     . Particular concern has been raised about their use in
     <strong>
      cosmetics
     </strong>
     and other
     <strong>
      personal care products
     </strong>
     . These products are often used near
     <strong>
      mucous membranes
     </strong>
     , like those in our eyes and mouths, which could make it easier for chemicals to be
     <strong>
      absorbed
     </strong>
     into our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     The exact level of risk is uncertain, but studies have suggested links between these
     <strong>
      compounds
     </strong>
     and conditions such as cancer, reproduction problems,
     <strong>
      developmental problems
     </strong>
     in children, and reduced
     <strong>
      immunity
     </strong>
     to disease. However, the level of
     <strong>
      exposure
     </strong>
     at which people become at risk is not yet clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     It may be impossible to completely avoid these chemicals, but people can take steps to reduce their exposure. Air and water
     <strong>
      filters
     </strong>
     , as well as reducing the amount of dust in our living spaces is one way to do this. Another way is to carefully check the ingredients of cosmetics as well as the materials in carpets and furniture before buying them.

     1. What kind of chemical bonds do forever chemicals have?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Forever chemicals contain fluorine-carbon bonds.
      <br/>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Why do forever chemicals last for so long?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Forever chemicals last for a long time because fluorine-carbon bonds are very difficult to break down.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Where have contaminants from forever chemicals been found?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Contaminants from forever chemicals have been found in people's bodies, in drinking water and in the soil.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Why is there particular concern about forever chemicals in cosmetics?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      As cosmetics are often used near mucous membranes, it may be easier for chemicals to be absorbed into our bodies.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. What should people check carefully when they buy things?
    </p>
