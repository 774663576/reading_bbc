     很长时间以来，三明治的组成都非常简单：两片面包夹着一片芝士或者火腿。但现如今，一种全新的三明治店正在将三明治变成一道精品美食。这些三明治小店通过社交媒体吸引了越来越多的人前去体验。本文探讨这些高价优质三明治的成功因素。

      词汇：sandwich 三明治

    <p>
     For many of us, sandwiches are something simple. Something we can take to work or school to avoid having to cook lunch, something we can buy quickly and cheaply. For many of us, we don't even need to stop working to eat them. Sandwiches could possibly be the ultimate
     <strong>
      convenience
     </strong>
     <strong>
      food
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But now it seems people are realising that the
     <strong>
      humble
     </strong>
     sandwich can be so much more. There's nothing
     <strong>
      convenient
     </strong>
     about waiting an hour and paying five times the price of a supermarket
     <strong>
      sarnie
     </strong>
     , but that's exactly what customers at one London sandwich shop have been doing. What is it that makes people so
     <strong>
      keen
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      get their hands on
     </strong>
     these £12 sandwiches?
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, it's the
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     . As
     <strong>
      baking
     </strong>
     has become more popular, good quality bread is both available and
     <strong>
      expected
     </strong>
     . The brains behind many of these
     <strong>
      gourmet
     </strong>
     sandwich shops are often people who have worked in the kitchens of top,
     <strong>
      Michelin-starred
     </strong>
     restaurants. This means that they bring a
     <strong>
      fine-dining
     </strong>
     attitude to their sandwiches,
     <strong>
      sourcing
     </strong>
     the best and freshest ingredients,
     <strong>
      combining
     </strong>
     them in new and creative ways. Secondly, it's the size. Max Halley, owner of a similar sandwich shop,
     <strong>
      boasts
     </strong>
     that the sandwiches his shop makes are twice the size of most burgers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, having sandwiches that look both huge and
     <strong>
      delicious
     </strong>
     is perfect for social media. While they may be more expensive than supermarket sandwiches, they are far more
     <strong>
      accessible
     </strong>
     than many other
     <strong>
      dining options
     </strong>
     . Being
     <strong>
      enticing
     </strong>
     , affordable, and
     <strong>
      trendy
     </strong>
     is an almost guaranteed way to attract attention online and bring crowds to the shops' doors. That's what's leading some to spend most of their lunch hour queueing up for a bite.
    </p>
    <p>
     And why not? They might be a bit too expensive to have every day, but taking time away from your desk to eat something that has been
     <strong>
      thoughtfully
     </strong>
     prepared from fresh, high-quality ingredients isn't a bad thing. It could be a good alternative to munching on industrially-produced supermarket sandwiches at your desk while staring at a spreadsheet.
