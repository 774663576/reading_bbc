     There is no doubt that
     <strong>
      artificial intelligence
     </strong>
     – or AI – has become an important part of our lives. It is no longer just a thing of
     <strong>
      science fiction
     </strong>
     : it's an incredible technological
     <strong>
      breakthrough
     </strong>
     that has changed the way we live. But there are fears that AI has become too intelligent and could be a threat to
     <strong>
      humanity
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     This claim might sound extreme, but a letter signed by more than 1,000 technology experts, including Tesla boss Elon Musk, called on the world to
     <strong>
      press pause
     </strong>
     on the development of more
     <strong>
      advanced
     </strong>
     AI because of the risks. Estonian billionaire Jaan Tallinn, for example, who helped develop
     <strong>
      communication app
     </strong>
     Skype, thinks we should be cautious. And The Future of Life Institute, a not-for-profit organisation, says that there should be a temporary pause in advanced AI development, saying that "AI systems with
     <strong>
      human-competitive
     </strong>
     intelligence can pose
     <strong>
      profound
     </strong>
     risks to society and humanity."
    </p>
    <p>
     This pessimistic outlook is supported by a report by investment bank Goldman Sachs that says AI could
     <strong>
      replace
     </strong>
     the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. But it may also mean new jobs and a
     <strong>
      productivity
     </strong>
     boom. We may argue that AI such as
     <strong>
      chatbots
     </strong>
     can help us.
     <strong>
      State-of-the-art
     </strong>
     ChatGPT, for example, has been helping some students write assignments. AI is allowing computers to think or act in a more human way. And
     <strong>
      machine learning
     </strong>
     means computers can learn what to do without being given explicit instructions. The technology is
     <strong>
      impressive
     </strong>
     , but as it starts to think for itself, will it
     <strong>
      outsmart
     </strong>
     us?
    </p>
    <p>
     Some people are more optimistic. AI
     <strong>
      advocates
     </strong>
     say the tech is already delivering real social and economic benefits for people. Meanwhile, the founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, has called on governments to work with industry to "limit the risks" of AI. But he says the technology could save lives, particularly in poorer countries. He says, "Just as the world needs its
     <strong>
      brightest
     </strong>
     people focused on its biggest problems, we will need to focus the world's best AIs on its biggest problems." If this happens, maybe humanity will have a future.
