     你还记得小时候玩过的电子游戏吗？那些曾经让我们爱不释手的玩具——掌上游戏机、电子宠物鸡？这些儿时 “必须拥有” 的小玩意儿和电子装置如今又重新流行起来。“随身英语” 讨论是什么驱使我们再度开始迷恋 “Gameboy” 等游戏。

     I’m sure we all have
     <strong>
      childhood memories
     </strong>
     – what we did at school, the food we ate, the games we played. But perhaps the most vivid
     <strong>
      recollections
     </strong>
     are those of the toys we played with.  There were many gadgets that may seem unsophisticated now but were the
     <strong>
      must-have items
     </strong>
     in the playground
     <strong>
      back in the day
     </strong>
     . Now it seems that our passion for
     <strong>
      nostalgia
     </strong>
     means some of them are making
     <strong>
      a comeback
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     One of my favourites was the Nintendo Game Boy, which returned to the shops last year, 30 years after it was first released. This handheld console has had some modifications, but still offers a simple gaming experience and
     <strong>
      a trip down memory lane
     </strong>
     ! If the Game Boy wasn’t from your era, how about the Tamagotchi? This egg-shaped, plastic pet that its owner had to keep ‘alive’ with constant care and attention - was the must-have item not long after its launch in 1996.
    </p>
    <p>
     These sometimes annoying ‘creatures’ were such a distraction in the classroom, they often got banned from school. But now, childlike adults can
     <strong>
      relive
     </strong>
     their wasted youth because Japanese manufacturer Bandai will soon release an all-colour, new-and-improved version of the
     <strong>
      classic
     </strong>
     toy. Its maker says it’s evolved from a pet into more of a character, and can inhabit different lands, as well as get married and breed.
    </p>
    <p>
     So what’s driving this demand for
     <strong>
      retro
     </strong>
     goods? Retail Analyst for Mintel, Chana Baram,  told the BBC people are searching for comfort in '
     <strong>
      the good old days'
     </strong>
     . Certainly, playing with an old toy brings back memories of our
     <strong>
      formative years
     </strong>
     and gives us a
     <strong>
      feel-good factor
     </strong>
     , but it’s also something brands and marketing companies want to
     <strong>
      cash in
     </strong>
     on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Retro toys are also something we could cash in on too. In the darkest corners of many attics and spare rooms lie the toys of Christmas past. And those once much-loved and played with presents may now have a value beyond nostalgia.
     <strong>
      Toyologist
     </strong>
     Peter Jenkinson told the BBC that any number of "toys that we all played with as kids are now worth more than a few quid". He suggests there’s a real collectors' market for certain old board games, Star Wars characters, Sindy dolls and Lego sets. However, if you own something like this, it may be just too precious to sell, and
     <strong>
      part with
     </strong>
     the connection to your childhood.
