     Next time you see a pigeon flying around, look at it with some respect - it might be able to help with the
     <strong>
      diagnosis
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      treatment
     </strong>
     of human
     <strong>
      diseases
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A recent study has shown that these birds could be trained to
     <strong>
      detect
     </strong>
     <strong>
      breast cancer
     </strong>
     from images as
     <strong>
      accurately
     </strong>
     as humans.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's all about their visual memory - these birds have plenty of it even if their
     <strong>
      brains
     </strong>
     are very small. Professor Edward Wasserman from the University of Iowa, a co-author of the study, says: "Pigeons can
     <strong>
      distinguish
     </strong>
     identities and emotional expressions on human faces, letters of the alphabet,
     <strong>
      misshapen pharmaceutical capsules
     </strong>
     , and even paintings by Monet versus Picasso."  And Wasserman adds that the birds' visual memory capacity is equally impressive, with a proven
     <strong>
      recall
     </strong>
     of more than 1,800 images.
    </p>
    <p>
     So how did the scientists find out about the amazing ability of these birds? They taught different pigeons to distinguish
     <strong>
      microscope images
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      cancerous
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      non-cancerous tissue
     </strong>
     and rewarded them with food every time they got it right.
    </p>
    <p>
     It didn't take long to get good results. After two weeks of training in 'pigeon medical school', the 'students' recorded 85%
     <strong>
      accuracy
     </strong>
     as they managed to identify cancerous tissue from images they had not seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
     But pigeons are not the only animals showing potential to help human diagnosis. A team at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences has shown that a dog can be trained to smell
     <strong>
      urine samples
     </strong>
     of patients to identify
     <strong>
      thyroid
     </strong>
     cancer. It lay down where it could smell cancer and turned away if not. The animals got it right in 30 cases out of 34.
    </p>
    <p>
     So don't
     <strong>
      dismiss
     </strong>
     the abilities of these animals. They might be much more intelligent than you think.
