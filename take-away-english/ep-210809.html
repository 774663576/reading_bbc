     We all know that cleaning our teeth is important, right? Because, if you don’t clean them and things go wrong, they can cause you a lot of pain and discomfort. We’re taught from a young age how to clean our teeth, but the question is – do we all clean our teeth in the same way? Is there a specific time,
     <strong>
      technique
     </strong>
     , or duration you should be incorporating into your dental routine?
    </p>
    <p>
     When our
     <strong>
      milk teeth
     </strong>
     first appear in our infant years, we are shown, often by our parents, how to clean them – a
     <strong>
      ritual
     </strong>
     normally
     <strong>
      accompanied
     </strong>
     by some kind of
     <strong>
      catchy
     </strong>
     song. As we mature, our
     <strong>
      baby teeth
     </strong>
     drop out, replaced by adult teeth. And soon it’s from trips to the dentists that we get more advice. And that’s the issue – when trying to discover the best way to brush your teeth, it feels like there are so many different tips and tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
     University College London (UCL) analysed 66 sources of
     <strong>
      toothbrushing
     </strong>
     advice from around the world. The most commonly recommended techniques incorporated
     <strong>
      circular
     </strong>
     movements and
     <strong>
      horizontal
     </strong>
     brush
     <strong>
      strokes
     </strong>
     . However, there were some deviations. The
     <strong>
      angle
     </strong>
     of the
     <strong>
      brush
     </strong>
     , use of
     <strong>
      vertical
     </strong>
     movements and
     <strong>
      rigorous
     </strong>
     <strong>
      scrubbing
     </strong>
     were all variations on brushing advice.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it seems that not one single technique is the standard method – so, if that’s the case, how do we know if we’re doing it right? Well – there is some standard advice. It seems that brushing for between two to three minutes, two or three times a day, is the best course of action. And if you’re one of these people who think it’s wise to brush straight after
     <strong>
      sugary
     </strong>
     foods to prevent
     <strong>
      decay
     </strong>
     , think again. Apparently, bacteria weaken the
     <strong>
      enamel
     </strong>
     almost immediately upon eating, so it’s wiser to wait for an hour or so before brushing.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while there is not one standardised technique, most dentists recommend a combination of horizontal and circular movements, lasting for between two to three minutes, two or three times a day. Do that, and you might not need too many trips to the dentist.
