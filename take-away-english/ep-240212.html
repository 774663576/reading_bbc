     如今，大部分人使用的智能手机都有拍照功能，想要拍摄和储存数码相片是件很容易的事。不过，从最开始的暗箱式相机到需要冲洗底片的胶片相机，从黑白相片到彩色相片，人们拍照的工具和方式经过了两百年的发展和演变。本期 “随身英语” 聊聊摄影技术的演变过程。

     Now, pretty much everyone has a camera in their back pocket – in the form of a
     <strong>
      smartphone
     </strong>
     . It's easy to take hundreds of photos without needing to really consider
     <strong>
      set up
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      storage
     </strong>
     . And it's very hard to imagine that, at one time,
     <strong>
      capturing
     </strong>
     an image was an almost impossible process.
    </p>
    <p>
     Going back even before traditional
     <strong>
      film cameras
     </strong>
     , there were
     <strong>
      camera obscuras
     </strong>
     . These were boxes with a small hole in them. Through one side, an image could be
     <strong>
      projected
     </strong>
     onto a wall on the opposite side of the box. However, the picture was
     <strong>
      upside down
     </strong>
     , very
     <strong>
      faint
     </strong>
     , and couldn't be captured in physical form – a bit like the images we see on modern
     <strong>
      projectors
     </strong>
     . In 1839, a French artist managed to work out a way to store and save photographs. He projected the image onto a shiny metal plate
     <strong>
      treated
     </strong>
     with chemicals. These images were in black and white. The first
     <strong>
      colour photo
     </strong>
     ever taken was of a tartan ribbon. The image was composed of three black and white photographs, each taken through a red, blue or green
     <strong>
      filter
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, how did we get from these early photographs to the kind we put into a
     <strong>
      frame
     </strong>
     and keep? Before the
     <strong>
      digital
     </strong>
     revolution, an image was captured on a
     <strong>
      negative
     </strong>
     , and this method is still chosen by some photographers today. A negative is an
     <strong>
      inverted
     </strong>
     image on a small strip of glass or plastic
     <strong>
      film
     </strong>
     which can then be
     <strong>
      exposed
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     light and
     <strong>
      processed
     </strong>
     onto
     <strong>
      photographic paper
     </strong>
     . When this was the main source of obtaining physical copies of photographs, it was a lengthy process with customers having to take the negatives to a shop and wait for their pictures to be
     <strong>
      developed
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     That was until digital photography came along in the 70s. Digital cameras captured images that could be saved as files and
     <strong>
      manipulated
     </strong>
     on a computer. Those are the kind of photos we take today on our phones.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, don't take the camera in your pocket for granted. It's been years in the making.
