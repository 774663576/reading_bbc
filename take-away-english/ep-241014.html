     If you could work from any location in the world, where would you go? Picture filling in a spreadsheet on a sandy Caribbean island, or maybe a little rooftop cafe in Rome where you can sip an espresso while editing a social media video. More and more countries are offering digital nomad visas and therefore the chance to work
     <strong>
      remotely
     </strong>
     , from wherever you'd like to.
    </p>
    <p>
     This way of working is on the rise. A 2023 report found that 11% of US workers now consider themselves a digital nomad, and this type of worker is expected to increase in number by more than 20 million in the next five years. Traditionally, digital nomads have worked
     <strong>
      freelance
     </strong>
     . They might be
     <strong>
      social media managers
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      software developers
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      copywriters
     </strong>
     , but now even
     <strong>
      traditional
     </strong>
     <strong>
      professions
     </strong>
     like accountants and lawyers are taking the leap. But what is the life of a digital nomad really like?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rowena Hennigan, who writes for Harvard Business Review, is a digital nomad along with her family. They have a '
     <strong>
      home base
     </strong>
     ' in Spain but frequently go away for
     <strong>
      workcations
     </strong>
     that can last from weeks to months. She says that compared to a 'traditional' model of raising children, "
     <strong>
      remote
     </strong>
     <strong>
      working
     </strong>
     has allowed my family to move away from that kind of intensity, and this way, we all get to move at a more sustainable and healthy
     <strong>
      pace
     </strong>
     ." Plus, her family are regularly exposed to new cultures, languages and natural beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though it doesn't work for everyone. Francesca Specter, a writer for The Guardian, decided to
     <strong>
      country-hop
     </strong>
     where her 'office' included beaches, cafes and
     <strong>
      coworking
     </strong>
     <strong>
      spaces.
     </strong>
     But along with struggling to find
     <strong>
      reliable wi-fi
     </strong>
     and fighting bouts of loneliness, she wrote that she felt envious as she cooled her
     <strong>
      overheating
     </strong>
     <strong>
      laptop
     </strong>
     in the shade while holidaymakers relaxed by the pool. She said, "I was chronically firefighting unglamorous concerns such as
     <strong>
      missing luggage
     </strong>
     or sleep deprivation after an overnight
     <strong>
      flight
     </strong>
     <strong>
      delay
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     So, it's not for everyone, but if you ever feel like escaping the
     <strong>
      rat-race
     </strong>
     , why not give it a go?
