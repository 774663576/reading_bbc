     “失败乃成功之母”。我们都希望能从失败中吸取经验教训，迎接成功。但为什么有时很难从错误中吸取教训？本文就此展开讨论。
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      词汇：failure 失败
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of us were told from an early age that, be it at school or in life, "you learn from your mistakes". But is this actually true?
    </p>
    <p>
     The short answer is 'yes' – failure can be a
     <strong>
      teachable moment
     </strong>
     . But learning from our mistakes is, in reality, very hard because we don't like to fail. It doesn't feel good, so we react to failure in
     <strong>
      impulsive
     </strong>
     and emotional ways, like giving up on a task
     <strong>
      prematurely
     </strong>
     , telling ourselves we don't care whether we
     <strong>
      succeed
     </strong>
     , or
     <strong>
      finding fault with
     </strong>
     the task itself. This is
     <strong>
      self-protective
     </strong>
     , according to Hallgeir Sjåstad, a professor of psychology and leadership at the Norwegian School of Economics. "Most of us want to think of ourselves as
     <strong>
      competent
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      capable
     </strong>
     ", he says, so when we fail "it
     <strong>
      poses
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     serious
     <strong>
      threat
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     our
     <strong>
      self-image
     </strong>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, there is research to suggest that there are some
     <strong>
      strategies
     </strong>
     to help us
     <strong>
      overcome
     </strong>
     the emotional
     <strong>
      barriers
     </strong>
     around failure. One of them is to
     <strong>
      adopt
     </strong>
     a
     <strong>
      third-person perspective
     </strong>
     . Instead of asking "Why did I fail?", we could ask "Why did Sam fail?", for example. Multiple studies by psychologist Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan show that adopting a third-person perspective helps to
     <strong>
      soften
     </strong>
     our negative emotional reactions, allowing us to look at failure more
     <strong>
      objectively
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A second strategy involves offering advice to others who may be
     <strong>
      in the same position as
     </strong>
     us. This strategy led to better levels of
     <strong>
      motivation
     </strong>
     and academic success in the test groups – involving both adults and children – that were asked to give advice based on their own failures. Professors Eskreis-Winkler, Fishbach and Duckworth found that the
     <strong>
      satisfaction
     </strong>
     of helping others "forces people to
     <strong>
      engage with
     </strong>
     their experience and what they have learned".
    </p>
    <p>
     The writer Samuel Beckett once said: "fail again, fail better". But it now seems that we should be saying: "fail again, fail smarter". Failure is an
     <strong>
      inevitable
     </strong>
     part of life, but by learning to overcome the emotional barriers around it, we may find the road to success is a little easier to
     <strong>
      navigate
     </strong>
     .

     1. True or False?
     <em>
      You learn from your mistakes.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      True. Failure can be a teachable moment.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. How does failure pose a threat to our self-image?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      According to Hallgeir Sjåstad,
     </strong>
     <strong>
      "
     </strong>
     <strong>
      most of us want to think of ourselves as
     </strong>
     <strong>
      competent and capable
     </strong>
     <strong>
      "
     </strong>
     <strong>
      . Our failures directly contradict with this idea of
     </strong>
     <strong>
      ourselves and therefore pose a threat to our self-image.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. What kind of barriers do we need to overcome to learn from failure?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      We need to overcome the emotional barriers around failure before we can learn
     </strong>
     <strong>
      from it.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. True or False?
     <em>
      A third-person perspective
     </em>
     <em>
      helps
     </em>
     <em>
      us be less emotional about our
     </em>
     <em>
      failures.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      True. Adopting a third-person perspective
     </strong>
     <strong>
      helps to soften our negative
     </strong>
     <strong>
      emotional reactions, allowing us to look at failure more objectively.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. How can helping others change our perspective on failure?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Giving advice based on our own failures forces us to engage with our
     </strong>
     <strong>
      experience and what we have learned.
     </strong>
