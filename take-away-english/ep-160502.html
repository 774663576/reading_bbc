     Do you have too many pairs of shoes or old gadgets lying around your home? I'm sure many of us have too much stuff that we don't really use and when it starts
     <strong>
      getting out of hand
     </strong>
     , it really is time to do some
     <strong>
      spring cleaning
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      de-clutter
     </strong>
     our lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, deciding which items to
     <strong>
      get rid of
     </strong>
     can be tricky especially if you are
     <strong>
      materialistic
     </strong>
     , believing that physical possessions are the most important thing in life. Also, some people are
     <strong>
      sentimental
     </strong>
     about letting go of their personal property. But if you haven't got room in your house to move, it's time to
     <strong>
      evaluate
     </strong>
     what is really important to you and decide what are your
     <strong>
      prized possessions
     </strong>
     and what is just
     <strong>
      junk
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of just
     <strong>
      chucking it away
     </strong>
     and filling up
     <strong>
      landfill sites
     </strong>
     , items could be
     <strong>
      recycled
     </strong>
     or given to a charity to re-sell. You could also make some money by using websites where people are willing to pay for second-hand goods. Some people have taken a
     <strong>
      minimalist
     </strong>
     approach, deliberately trying to keep life simple. Bea Johnson, author of Zero Waste Home, has done this. She says "we've asked really true questions, and evaluated every single thing that we have. There is nothing that we
     <strong>
      overlooked
     </strong>
     . I even came to look at my vegetable peeler for example and asked myself, 'do I really need that vegetable peeler'?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, if you're a
     <strong>
      shopaholic
     </strong>
     or a
     <strong>
      fashion-victim
     </strong>
     it's hard to stop buying and shopping online makes purchasing stuff very easy. James Wallman is a writer and journalist – he questions what we actually need. He says "I'm not anti-stuff – stuff is good. I'm anti too much stuff and I'm anti the wrong stuff. Don't go out and buy that
     <strong>
      labelled
     </strong>
     good that you think is going to make people think something more of you. That's not going to make you happy."
    </p>
    <p>
     This sounds like good advice. It's good to
     <strong>
      take stock
     </strong>
     of what we have and what we really need. But there are still some things I just can't face
     <strong>
      parting company
     </strong>
     with; my CD collection, even though I now download my music, and my childhood teddy bear. What about you – have you got something that you just can't throw away?
