     Many of us wear
     <strong>
      trainers
     </strong>
     , or
     <strong>
      sneakers
     </strong>
     as they are called in American English. They might not seem like anything special, but these items of
     <strong>
      footwear
     </strong>
     have become an obsession for some people. Get ready to meet the
     <strong>
      sneakerheads
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     From their beginnings as
     <strong>
      practical
     </strong>
     footwear for athletes, trainers or sneakers have become big business. They are now a massive part of the global fashion industry, and the sneaker
     <strong>
      market
     </strong>
     could be worth $120bn by 2026. Trainers started to gain
     <strong>
      cultural cachet
     </strong>
     in the 1970s due to the popularity of basketball and football in US and UK youth culture, says fashion gallery curator Ligaya Salazar.
     <strong>
      Celebrity endorsements
     </strong>
     from the likes of Run DMC and Michael Jordan boosted the market through the 1980s and 90s. Brendan Dunne, host of a podcast dedicated to sneakers, describes how, as they became cooler and more expensive, sneakers became
     <strong>
      status signifiers
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     While most trainers are made for the
     <strong>
      mass market
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      limited-edition
     </strong>
     pairs are made to
     <strong>
      appeal to
     </strong>
     those who are looking for something special. Sneakerheads are those who collect
     <strong>
      rare
     </strong>
     trainers, sometimes paying thousands of dollars for a
     <strong>
      pair
     </strong>
     . Dunne compares it to art collecting, pointing out that they have been sold by major auction houses and are seen by some as an
     <strong>
      investment
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Trainer
     <strong>
      manufacturers
     </strong>
     have seen this market for rare sneakers as a good business opportunity and have teamed up with celebrities to produce limited edition pairs. This feeds into the
     <strong>
      resale market
     </strong>
     for this footwear. Some sneakerheads spend hours camping outside shops to get their hands on the most
     <strong>
      desirable
     </strong>
     limited editions which they can then
     <strong>
      flip
     </strong>
     for a huge profit.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, an item that started as an everyday functional object for people playing sports can now also be a
     <strong>
      high-fashion
     </strong>
     item worth thousands of dollars.
