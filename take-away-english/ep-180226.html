     Going to the gym can be something that many people find
     <strong>
      a gruelling experience
     </strong>
     . It takes time and effort, it often hurts, and it can be extremely
     <strong>
      tedious
     </strong>
     . Most
     <strong>
      weight-related exercises
     </strong>
     are a combination of
     <strong>
      sets
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      reps
     </strong>
     . In order to see any significant change from any one exercise, it will probably need to be repeated six to eight times, for a minimum of three sets, for about three months. Then there's
     <strong>
      cardio
     </strong>
     . For some, there's nothing more boring than endless miles spent running on a
     <strong>
      treadmill
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But what if there were a way to alleviate the boredom of exercise while still getting a good
     <strong>
      work out
     </strong>
     ? Luckily for us, there’s virtual reality.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the past, “playing video games was a
     <strong>
      sedentary
     </strong>
     experience,” says Jo Stauffer of the VR Health Institute, “but VR changes all of that". He says that the room-scale experience engages your body in full.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many VR games are played while standing. In order to play properly, the player is forced to move around
     <strong>
      swinging
     </strong>
     their arms or using their legs. After an hour of this on a regular enough basis, it’s not surprising that many people unexpectedly find themselves a little
     <strong>
      fitter
     </strong>
     . There are already a number of virtual reality games which, deliberately or not, result in their player ‘
     <strong>
      getting a
     </strong>
     good
     <strong>
      sweat on
     </strong>
     ’ if played for enough time. For example, there’s a first person shooter which forces the player to
     <strong>
      sidestep, duck
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      dodge
     </strong>
     incoming projectiles. That’s cardio. Or there’s a music game which forces players to
     <strong>
      shadowbox
     </strong>
     in order to hit the notes – that’s an
     <strong>
      upper-body
     </strong>
     workout.
    </p>
    <p>
     The potential for VR to help people get fit has been noticed by one company. They want to take the whole experience into the gym. They are making a bespoke
     <strong>
      resistance machine
     </strong>
     , designed to be used in combination with a VR headset. Players challenge a virtual opponent in a series of games, which results in a 30-minute
     <strong>
      full-body
     </strong>
     work out. However, the cost of the equipment is expensive and there are safety concerns to be worked out, says J P Gownder from the consultancy Forrester. So
     <strong>
      don’t
     </strong>
     <strong>
      hang up your gym shorts
     </strong>
     just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Although it’s early days, for those of us who struggle to overcome the tedium of exercise, a new solution could be coming. And a world where a person can exercise and have fun at the same time might be something that many people would want – virtual or not.
