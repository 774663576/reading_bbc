     近来，网络安全对于个人和企业来说都是一个不可忽视的问题。每个建立了网络连接的用户都面临着一个真实存在的危险 — 被黑客攻击，比如受到数字病毒的感染或某种形式的数据盗窃。然而说来也怪，在大多数情况下，威胁网络安全的始作俑者并不是计算机本身，而是使用互联网的用户，因为人们总在犯一些看似微不足道，却常常很关键的错误。本集《随身英语》介绍三个引起人们加强网络安全意识的相关小贴士。

     It's a dangerous world out there in
     <strong>
      cyberspace
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Hackers
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      viruses
     </strong>
     , and
     <strong>
      malware
     </strong>
     , among others, all exist and are very real threats. A 2017 UK government
     <strong>
      cyber-security
     </strong>
     <strong>
      breaches
     </strong>
     survey showed that in the preceding 12 months, just under half of the companies asked had identified an attack or breach. That could have been disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
     The problem is not the computers,
     <strong>
      firewalls
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      encryption
     </strong>
     - it's us. People are bad at following good cyber-security
     <strong>
      protocol
     </strong>
     – such as using an effective password. We're also pretty dumb when it comes to clicking on links and downloading content we shouldn't, Ian Pratt, co-founder of cyber-security firm Bromium told the BBC. With that in mind, here are three tips to keep you 'cyber-safe'.
    </p>
    <p>
     Passwords are a weakness. The ideal password should be at least eight
     <strong>
      characters
     </strong>
     long, and contain upper and lower case letters, symbols and numbers. And don't use a common word such as 'password'. "This makes you
     <strong>
      vulnerable
     </strong>
     to a
     <strong>
      scrape attack.
     </strong>
     This is where hackers take the most common passwords and try them on millions of accounts," Thomas Pedersen from OneLogin, an identity and access management company, told the BBC.
    </p>
    <p>
     Keep your equipment
     <strong>
      up-to-date
     </strong>
     by installing the latest security
     <strong>
      updates
     </strong>
     for your computer - obviously. Less obvious perhaps, is doing so for other technology also connected to the internet – such as your
     <strong>
      router
     </strong>
     . A recent study carried out by the American Consumer Institute Centre for Citizen Research found that "five out of six routers are inadequately updated for known security
     <strong>
      flaws
     </strong>
     ." These require software updates, too. And don't forget your other smart devices, such as your smart TV!
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, consider enabling
     <strong>
      multi-factor authentication
     </strong>
     for your accounts. That's where a mobile phone or
     <strong>
      dongle
     </strong>
     is used to verify access to a device. If your password becomes
     <strong>
      compromised
     </strong>
     , no access can be obtained without your second authentication device… so don't lose your phone!  In the future,
     <strong>
      biometrics
     </strong>
     such as voice and fingerprint may make this easier.
    </p>
    <p>
     The internet is wonderful, but security threats do exist. Fortunately, with a little common sense and forethought, you can be secure from the majority of cyber-security threats.
