     每个人一生中大约有26年的时间都是在睡梦中度过的。正因如此，我们乐于谈论自己睡眠的质量并且想办法让自己睡得更好。在过去10年里，有关睡眠的研究成果丰硕。本文总结了目前对于睡眠意义的各项研究结论。

     "I'm
     <strong>
      knackered
     </strong>
     - have you got any tips for
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      good night's sleep
     </strong>
     ?" Not only is sleep a common feature of our small talk, we've also spent decades trying to understand and explain it. After all, we spend on average 26 years of our lives
     <strong>
      asleep
     </strong>
     . So, what do we know? Here are the highlights of the last decade of research.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the most intriguing developments is in the study of
     <strong>
      lucid dreaming
     </strong>
     – it seems it's possible to communicate with people while they're sleeping. In a study called 'Real-time dialogue between experimenters and
     <strong>
      dreamers
     </strong>
     during
     <strong>
      REM
     </strong>
     <strong>
      sleep
     </strong>
     ', researchers asked questions to participants in a lucid dream. The dreamers signalled the answers using pre-agreed eye or facial movements. They were accurate, suggesting they could access their
     <strong>
      cognitive functions
     </strong>
     such as
     <strong>
      working memory
     </strong>
     while sleeping. This interaction between
     <strong>
      dreamworld
     </strong>
     and reality has brought excitement to the sleep science community.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sleep can also help our memory and problem-solving. A 2023 review of research by Denis and Cairney noted that brain regions that are used to learn new things, are reactivated during sleep. That means while we're sleeping, our brains replay our memories of what happened during the day, which is believed to be crucial for
     <strong>
      memory retention
     </strong>
     . And, if you've ever felt it was best to
     <strong>
      sleep on
     </strong>
     a tricky problem and solve it in the morning, you might have scientific backing! A 2019 study by Sanders and colleagues found that people were more likely to solve a tricky problem the next day if the problem had been activated in their brains during sleep. So, if you're stuck,
     <strong>
      rest up
     </strong>
     and return to it in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if you're unlucky enough to suffer with
     <strong>
      sleep deprivation
     </strong>
     ? Unfortunately, you may be at higher risk of negative moods and worse emotional regulation, according to a 2021 meta-analysis called 'The effect of sleep deprivation and restriction on mood, emotion, and emotion regulation'. The good news is there are plenty of tips to help you with your
     <strong>
      sleep hygiene
     </strong>
     . The UK's National Health Service recommends having a set time to start
     <strong>
      winding down
     </strong>
     , meditation before bed, which they call '
     <strong>
      beditation
     </strong>
     ', and avoiding
     <strong>
      caffeine
     </strong>
     before bed.
