    <p>
     What do you read when you are travelling by train or bus?
    </p>
    <p>
     What are other passengers reading? Perhaps a woman sitting near you is reading a
     <strong>
      trashy
     </strong>
     <strong>
      romantic novel
     </strong>
     . A man is reading a
     <strong>
      serious
     </strong>
     <strong>
      biography
     </strong>
     about a politician. And there's a student reading an English
     <strong>
      textbook
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     What do their
     <strong>
      choices
     </strong>
     <strong>
      say about them
     </strong>
     ? Do you
     <strong>
      judge
     </strong>
     them by what they are reading?
    </p>
    <p>
     I have got to tell you that your
     <strong>
      impressions
     </strong>
     of them are probably completely wrong. The woman reading the romantic novel could be a lawyer. She just wants a
     <strong>
      light read
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to take her mind off work
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The man reading the biography wants you to think that he is an
     <strong>
      intellectual
     </strong>
     , but he is just
     <strong>
      showing
     </strong>
     <strong>
      off
     </strong>
     . The student reading the textbook isn't a student at all. She's an English teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Publishers
     </strong>
     know that some people are
     <strong>
      self-conscious
     </strong>
     about what they read on public transport and so they put out different
     <strong>
      versions
     </strong>
     of a
     <strong>
      cover
     </strong>
     . For example, books about Harry Potter have an
     <strong>
      original
     </strong>
     cover for young readers and then another more serious version for adults.
    </p>
    <p>
     So next time you are on a train, look around and see what other people are reading, but
     <strong>
      don't jump to any conclusions
     </strong>
     . You will probably be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here is a situation where you could say, "
     <strong>
      Don't judge a book by its cover
     </strong>
     ".
