     一角鲸是一种头上长有长牙的海洋哺乳动物。专家表示，随着气候变暖，海冰融化，船舶航线增多，海洋噪声增加，到2025年，一角鲸有可能会因海洋噪音污染而灭绝。本期 “随身英语” 介绍这种被人称作 “海洋独角兽” 的动物所面临的生存威胁。

    <p>
     Of all the creatures on the planet, the
     <strong>
      narwhal
     </strong>
     is one of the strangest looking. It's a whale which has a large
     <strong>
      protruding
     </strong>
     <strong>
      tusk
     </strong>
     coming out of its head; that's how it got its nickname, the
     <strong>
      unicorn
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of the sea.
     </strong>
     They live in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of Canada, Russia and East Greenland. However, experts say some populations of narwhal could be
     <strong>
      extinct
     </strong>
     by 2025, and it's all because of noise pollution.
    </p>
    <p>
     Narwhals rely on
     <strong>
      echolocation
     </strong>
     , which they use to find food and navigate their surroundings. The animal produces a sound wave which
     <strong>
      bounces off
     </strong>
     an object. They pick this reflected sound up through their
     <strong>
      lower jaw
     </strong>
     , and information on features like size and speed passes to their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, increase in human
     <strong>
      marine activity
     </strong>
     , as well as climate change, has resulted in the Arctic Ocean becoming noisier, which means it's more difficult for narwhals to rely on sound. Susanna Blackwell, who studies the effects of underwater noise on
     <strong>
      marine
     </strong>
     <strong>
      animals
     </strong>
     , told the BBC that there is noisier activity in the Arctic Ocean than ever because, as sea ice melts, new
     <strong>
      navigation
     </strong>
     <strong>
      routes
     </strong>
     are opening. And while icebergs breaking and creaking have been part of the ocean
     <strong>
      soundscape
     </strong>
     for hundreds of years, man-made noise is much harder for animals to
     <strong>
      adapt
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     , particularly as these changes are so sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
     Research published in Science Advances in 2023 recorded the reactions of narwhals to the simulated noises of oil expeditions made by a patrol vessel. The scientists
     <strong>
      tagged
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      tracked
     </strong>
     the creatures and found that, on hearing these sounds, they ended
     <strong>
      deep
     </strong>
     <strong>
      dives
     </strong>
     and stopped
     <strong>
      clicking
     </strong>
     , the echolocation signal they use for finding food underwater. This is the same reaction narwhals have to
     <strong>
      orcas
     </strong>
     , who
     <strong>
      hunt
     </strong>
     them, meaning human-made noise could trigger the creature's 'threat button'.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what can we do? Charlotte Findlay, a postdoctoral fellow at Aarhus University, says "noise is actually quite easy to solve. We need to either turn it off or turn it down."
