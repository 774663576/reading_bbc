    <p>
     I am a massive science fiction
     <strong>
      geek
     </strong>
     . Ever since I was young, I’ve been captivated by tales of
     <strong>
      interstellar
     </strong>
     adventure, aliens, robots, and
     <strong>
      cutting-edge
     </strong>
     technology. I always loved the concept of
     <strong>
      cyborgs
     </strong>
     . That’s a human-robot
     <strong>
      hybrid
     </strong>
     . They are ordinary humans who have been
     <strong>
      enhanced
     </strong>
     in some way by technology; more intelligence, faster speed or better resilience to disease and damage. Great ideas, but I never thought I’d see them in my lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, I stand corrected.
     <strong>
      Integrated
     </strong>
     biology and technology is already here and people have wasted no time utilising it to
     <strong>
      re-engineer
     </strong>
     their bodies. Take, for example, Neil Harbisson, who has an
     <strong>
      antenna protruding
     </strong>
     from his head that allows him to hear colour, or Moon Ribas, who has an
     <strong>
      implant
     </strong>
     that allows her to sense
     <strong>
      seismic
     </strong>
     activity. Now, neither are abilities that I particularly
     <strong>
      covet
     </strong>
     , but it's a start.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it doesn’t end there. As technology increases so too will our ability to enhance ourselves through it. One of the latest developments is the
     <strong>
      graphene
     </strong>
     tattoo. Not an actual tattoo at all, but more like a
     <strong>
      patch
     </strong>
     , the graphene tattoo could revolutionise biomedical monitoring.
    </p>
    <p>
     It looks much like a
     <strong>
      transparent
     </strong>
     plaster, but with a gold coloured
     <strong>
      circuit
     </strong>
     <strong>
      board
     </strong>
     contained within it. This circuit is the graphene. Graphene is a form of
     <strong>
      carbon
     </strong>
     , but it’s 200 times stronger than steel and
     <strong>
      conducts
     </strong>
     electricity better than gold, which is the
     <strong>
      component
     </strong>
     typically used in electronics.
    </p>
    <p>
     The human body is basically an electrical machine. When in contact with the skin, the graphene in the plaster is able to read and conduct the electricity – allowing it to easily be used as a medical monitor for heart-rate and pulse, among other things. And even more, graphene tattoos can be used as
     <strong>
      bioelectronic
     </strong>
     controllers, as demonstrated by one engineer who attached them to his eyelids in order to direct which way a drone flew, just by looking with his eyes!
    </p>
    <p>
     I know that biotechnology is a long way from allowing humans to be able to lift a car or run half-way around the world in a single day, like I wanted to be able to do when I was a child. But, it’s improving all the time and once the price of graphene falls, who knows what else we’ll be able to do? I’ll see you in the future!
