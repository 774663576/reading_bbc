      词汇：breathing
      <strong>
       呼吸

     Struggling with
     <strong>
      insomnia
     </strong>
     ? Worried by
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     ? The first piece of advice that you are likely to see is to try
     <strong>
      breathing exercises
     </strong>
     . From ancient yoga practitioners to modern health professionals, experts have made this recommendation. But how can simple breathing activities have such a significant effect on our mental and physical health?
    </p>
    <p>
     Once we consider how essential
     <strong>
      oxygen
     </strong>
     is for life, it might seem obvious that focusing on this can help our health. Our nervous system
     <strong>
      instinctively
     </strong>
     regulates the
     <strong>
      flow
     </strong>
     of oxygen into our
     <strong>
      lungs
     </strong>
     . Possibly because of body image concerns, many people hold in their stomachs, taking
     <strong>
      shallow breaths
     </strong>
     . This can lead our body to increase our
     <strong>
      breathing rate
     </strong>
     to compensate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our breathing also gets faster when we're stressed or anxious. When this happens, our
     <strong>
      sympathetic nervous system
     </strong>
     triggers a
     <strong>
      fight-or-flight response
     </strong>
     . As well as affecting breathing, this increases our heart rate and produces adrenaline to prepare our muscles for action. Stress and anxiety can thus be linked with
     <strong>
      rapid breathing
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     To recover from a threat, our
     <strong>
      parasympathetic nervous system
     </strong>
     can put our body into a
     <strong>
      rest-and-digest state
     </strong>
     allowing us to relax and be calm. In this state, breathing and heart rates slow. However, it appears that slow, deep breathing can also make this happen. It's also notable that when we focus on
     <strong>
      breathing techniques
     </strong>
     , we can be distracted from the issues that are causing us stress.
    </p>
    <p>
     Experts recommend using our
     <strong>
      diaphragm
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      inhale
     </strong>
     deeply, filling our lungs completely and then
     <strong>
      holding our breath
     </strong>
     for a few seconds before
     <strong>
      exhaling
     </strong>
     . Other recommended techniques include breathing through alternating
     <strong>
      nostrils
     </strong>
     . So next time you feel anxious or stressed, why not try some breathing techniques to help you relax?
