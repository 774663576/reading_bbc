     我们都知道到气候在变化，以及这些变化对我们星球所带来的影响。工业化、一次性文化和人口增长是导致平均气温上升和更多极端天气事件的部分原因。科学家们不断发现更多的证据表明情况正在恶化。

     We are all aware of climate change and how it is
     <strong>
      threatening
     </strong>
     our
     <strong>
      planet
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Industrialisation
     </strong>
     , our
     <strong>
      disposable
     </strong>
     <strong>
      culture
     </strong>
     and population growth are some of the reasons why we are seeing
     <strong>
      average temperatures
     </strong>
     rise and more
     <strong>
      extreme weather
     </strong>
     events. And scientists are finding more evidence that the situation is getting worse.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rise in
     <strong>
      global temperatures
     </strong>
     is the most important thing that experts analyse. They say keeping it below 1.5
     <strong>
      centigrade
     </strong>
     will avoid the worst
     <strong>
      climate impacts
     </strong>
     . But
     <strong>
      The World Meteorological Organisation
     </strong>
     says there’s a 20% possibility the critical mark will be broken in any one year before 2024 – and there’s a 70% chance it will be broken in one or more months in those five years.
    </p>
    <p>
     This isn’t great news for
     <strong>
      the Arctic
     </strong>
     , where the impact will be greatest: warming by twice the global average this year. Temperatures in
     <strong>
      the Siberian Arctic
     </strong>
     reached record averages in June – one area reached more than 30C. This
     <strong>
      heat
     </strong>
     helped to
     <strong>
      fan
     </strong>
     wildfires, which in turn released 59 million tonnes of
     <strong>
      carbon dioxide
     </strong>
     . Meanwhile, in Western Europe, experts predict over the next five years
     <strong>
      rising sea levels
     </strong>
     will cause more storms.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these events should not surprise us. Professor Martin Siegert from Imperial College London told the BBC this is “in line with predictions of
     <strong>
      global warming
     </strong>
     going back decades now. We don’t really need further confirmation of this problem, but here it is anyway.” He thinks if you change the weather in the Arctic you are likely to see the effects
     <strong>
      ripple out
     </strong>
     around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     We know that
     <strong>
      carbon emissions
     </strong>
     from human activities is partly to blame for our warming planet, but it seems measures to reduce this are not having much effect. The BBC’s Justin Rowlatt writing about the effects of events in the Arctic, says: “Climate scientists simply don’t know for certain what those effects are likely to be, but climate models suggest they will lead to more extreme weather events –
     <strong>
      heatwaves
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      severe storms
     </strong>
     .”
