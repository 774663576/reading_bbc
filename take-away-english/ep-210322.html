     在与家人和朋友交流时，你喜欢发短信还是喜欢打电话？近些年来，随着手机的普及，通过短信交流变得越来越流行。有些人甚至因为忙着发短信，而没空接电话。本文探讨发短信和打电话的利与弊。

     <strong>
      词汇：communication 交流
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The telephone was an amazing invention. People could finally speak to each other
     <strong>
      instantly
     </strong>
     from one home to another. The
     <strong>
      mobile phone
     </strong>
     took this technology further, meaning we could
     <strong>
      make contact
     </strong>
     <strong>
      with
     </strong>
     people to and from almost anywhere in the world. But despite having the instant ability to talk to one another, it seems many of us prefer to communicate by
     <strong>
      text
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     I don’t mean we have taken up letter writing again. Although a handwritten letter has a
     <strong>
      personal touch
     </strong>
     , sending it by
     <strong>
      snail mail
     </strong>
     is too slow to satisfy our desire to
     <strong>
      keep in touch
     </strong>
     immediately. But what our
     <strong>
      smartphones
     </strong>
     now allow us to do is enable us to communicate in any number of quick, cheap but silent ways. A study in the UK a few years ago found 49 per cent of teenagers preferred to send a text rather than speak to someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Certainly sending an
     <strong>
      SMS
     </strong>
     , text or message via a
     <strong>
      chat app
     </strong>
     means we can
     <strong>
      compose
     </strong>
     what we want to say, and we can be more efficient in saying it – especially if we
     <strong>
      express ourselves
     </strong>
     by using
     <strong>
      emojis
     </strong>
     . It can also be quicker than having to chat with someone, although I feel you can still end up wasting time by having a full discussion by text!
     <strong>
      Text messaging
     </strong>
     also allows
     <strong>
      privacy
     </strong>
     – other people can’t overhear your text if you’re in a public place such as on a train.
    </p>
    <p>
     But texting instead of talking can seem
     <strong>
      antisocial
     </strong>
     ; we may even forget the art of
     <strong>
      pleasantries
     </strong>
     . A text can be misinterpreted too because you miss out on a speaker’s
     <strong>
      intonation
     </strong>
     . Neuroscientist Professor Sophie Scott told the BBC: “We always speak with melody and intonation to our voice… you take that channel of information out of communication, you lose another way that sense is being
     <strong>
      conveyed
     </strong>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course texting and talking is the worst thing to do. Who deserves your attention when two people are communicating with you? It’s then we have to decide who has the most interesting thing to say!
