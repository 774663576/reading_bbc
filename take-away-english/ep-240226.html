     许多城市都设有地下列车系统，这让日常出行变得更高效、更环保。如今，有人在探讨应不应该把道路也挪到地下，从而为咖啡馆、公园等更美观的场所腾出地上空间。本文围绕改在地下修建道路这一提议现实与否展开讨论。

     Can you imagine living in a city without roads on the surface? We've already put trains underground successfully, but the idea of building roads underground is now inspiring
     <strong>
      urban planners
     </strong>
     and engineers. Bradley Garrett, author of 'Subterranean London', says that there's something magical about things happening out of sight, that it "gives
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      illusion of seamlessness
     </strong>
     ". So, how might underground roads reshape our cities and redefine the daily
     <strong>
      commute
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     "If you want to revitalise the city centre, you
     <strong>
      pedestrianise
     </strong>
     the roads," says Tom Ireland, the director of tunnelling at engineering company Aurecon. Moving roads below the surface can
     <strong>
      free up space
     </strong>
     for parks, pavement cafes, and other
     <strong>
      public amenities
     </strong>
     , improving the urban environment and mental health of the population. Not only that, it could reduce traffic
     <strong>
      congestion
     </strong>
     above ground, and who doesn't want to be freed from
     <strong>
      noise pollution
     </strong>
     and the sight of
     <strong>
      gridlocked traffic
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Underground roads could also make
     <strong>
      self-driving cars
     </strong>
     more popular, which are often more
     <strong>
      energy-efficient
     </strong>
     , and less prone to
     <strong>
      collisions
     </strong>
     . This, in a world trying to reduce its
     <strong>
      fuel consumption
     </strong>
     , is appealing. But if driverless cars end up becoming more attractive than public transport, it could actually make traffic worse, because cars take up more space than trains and buses.
    </p>
    <p>
     That's not the only drawback that may come with a
     <strong>
      motorised
     </strong>
     world beneath our feet. The construction and maintenance of underground
     <strong>
      infrastructure
     </strong>
     are both
     <strong>
      hazardous
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      energy-intensive
     </strong>
     processes. On top of that, most people don't like the feeling of confinement you get when you're travelling through underground tunnels, which may affect public perception.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dreams of
     <strong>
      roadless
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      car-free
     </strong>
     cities bring both excitement and scepticism. We may fantasise about cityscapes made for pedestrians, but perhaps getting more people to use public transport rather than private
     <strong>
      vehicles
     </strong>
     would be more worth our time and resources.
