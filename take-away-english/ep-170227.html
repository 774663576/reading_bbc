     How do you pay for things in a shop? Perhaps you like the
     <strong>
      tangible
     </strong>
     reliability of
     <strong>
      hard cash
     </strong>
     ? Maybe the financial flexibility of a credit card suits you better? Or perhaps you prefer the simple convenience of a smartphone?
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever you use today, experts believe all these methods could soon become
     <strong>
      outdated
     </strong>
     . Instead, we will use our bodies: our eyes, our fingerprints, even our mere presence in the store. In fact it's happening already. Amazon are trialling stores which have no
     <strong>
      checkouts
     </strong>
     , where technology tracks the items you've taken from the shelves and deducts the total from your account when you leave the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
     French supermarket Monoprix takes a different path: you choose your
     <strong>
      groceries
     </strong>
     and leave them with a human
     <strong>
      cashier
     </strong>
     . You then leave the shop while the cashier
     <strong>
      tallies up
     </strong>
     your bill, charges your account, and organises delivery to your home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Amir Sajed, chief executive of Barclaycard, told the BBC that such new developments
     <strong>
      spell
     </strong>
     the end of the plastic credit card. Instead,
     <strong>
      wearable
     </strong>
     items such as rings, bracelets and keychains will carry
     <strong>
      chips
     </strong>
     that allow shoppers to "
     <strong>
      seamlessly
     </strong>
     shop, going between the web, an app or in store," he says.
    </p>
    <p>
     And while all the above payment methods are
     <strong>
      underpinned
     </strong>
     by accounts held in traditional currencies, let's not forget the rise of alternatives such as Litecoin. Such
     <strong>
      virtual currencies
     </strong>
     can rise in value very quickly, but are also susceptible to
     <strong>
      crashes
     </strong>
     and threats from hackers. Who knows, perhaps something totally new will
     <strong>
      take off
     </strong>
     that changes money as we know it? One such possibility is explored in the movie In Time. It imagines a futuristic society in which the currency is time itself, where people trade the amount of time they have left to live.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or perhaps we'd do better to
     <strong>
      wind back the clock
     </strong>
     to the simpler financial world of the
     <strong>
      barter economy
     </strong>
     . While the term
     <strong>
      conjures
     </strong>
     images of sacks of grain and herds of sheep being exchanged in ancient times, there are signs that bartering is
     <strong>
      making a comeback
     </strong>
     in today's world of modern technology. Startup Let's Barter India has developed an app which facilitates the exchange of goods, and already has around 100,000 members.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe the only thing we know for certain is that money will keep evolving.
