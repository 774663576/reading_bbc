     If you ask most people what the best universities in the UK are, they will probably answer Oxford or Cambridge. These
     <strong>
      elite
     </strong>
     educational establishments were founded 800 years ago; since then
     <strong>
      being offered a place
     </strong>
     has been seen as the pinnacle of
     <strong>
      academic life
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite these being the places to go to for
     <strong>
      high-achieving
     </strong>
     students, the number of
     <strong>
      undergraduate
     </strong>
     students from the UK attending Oxbridge (Oxford and Cambridge) has dropped. Student figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency and from the universities show 7% fewer UK undergraduates at Oxford and 5% fewer at Cambridge compared with 2007-08.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course competition for places is
     <strong>
      intense
     </strong>
     ,and British students
     <strong>
      compete with
     </strong>
     those from abroad. Overseas undergraduate student numbers rose by 51% at Oxford and 65% at Cambridge. Oxford says it
     <strong>
      recruits
     </strong>
     the "best
     <strong>
      talent
     </strong>
     from around the world"; and on
     <strong>
      postgraduate
     </strong>
     courses at Cambridge, there are now more overseas students than those from the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
     The BBC's education correspondent Sean Coughlan explains that in the UK "there have been calls for more places for
     <strong>
      disadvantaged
     </strong>
     youngsters as well as ethnic minority students and white working-class youngsters." But despite an ambition to improve
     <strong>
      social mobility
     </strong>
     , the total number of UK students being awarded places at Oxbridge has gone down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, told the BBC that "Oxford and Cambridge attract many international students, but they must ensure that their
     <strong>
      student body
     </strong>
     is balanced… This means letting in UK and international students based on
     <strong>
      ability
     </strong>
     and not on ability to pay." But an Oxford spokeswoman said "Sustaining
     <strong>
      excellence
     </strong>
     requires
     <strong>
      diversity
     </strong>
     , and our commitment to achieving this balance, and making Oxford more reflective of modern society includes reaching out to and selecting the best talent from all over the world."
    </p>
    <p>
     With overseas students from outside the EU paying higher fees for
     <strong>
      tuition
     </strong>
     , is the decline in places for British students inevitable? This is not known, but other
     <strong>
      prestigious
     </strong>
     British universities such as UCL and Exeter have seen numbers of UK student rise. One solution may be to expand and offer more places. But whatever happens, competition for an Oxbridge place will always remain high.
