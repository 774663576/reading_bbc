     If a stranger offered you money to keep a suitcase in your spare room, would you accept? How about the other way round: if you had too many belongings, would you consider trusting someone you met online with their

     And it's just one
     <strong>
      player
     </strong>
     in the booming 'sharing economy', an industry that relies on people renting out things like their beds, bikes and even parking spaces. Airbnb, a company valued at 200bn RMB, provides a platform for those renting property

     All their
     <strong>

     revolve around one simple word: trust. So, how does Stashbee

     ? BBC journalist Dougal Shaw decided to try it out for himself. He had some
     <strong>
      odds and ends
     </strong>
     to store while
     <strong>
      renovating
     </strong>
     his house, and met a host through the site who could keep them for 475 RMB for two months. All relatively smooth and

     in the traditional storage industry, such as Big Yellow and Access, aren't convinced. A representative from Access told Shaw he was sceptical about storing with “amateurs”. He cited
     <strong>

     access to the items and better security as the main advantages of his service. Cost

     it would

      set you back
     </strong>
     an extra 160 RMB to store with them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stashbee agree that tackling security concerns is important, but say business success depends more on people overcoming a
     <strong>
      distrust
     </strong>
     of strangers we've been taught since childhood.They aren't alone. Companies such as Costockage, Roost and Spacer all run similar storage businesses, and are all
     <strong>
      banking on
     </strong>
     a shift in consumer attitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
     And the concept of social storage doesn't stop there. CityStasher believe there's
     <strong>
      a gap in the market
     </strong>
     for those who want to store things for extremely short periods of time. For example, if you have three hours to kill in a city before your train leaves, what do you do with your suitcase? CityStasher hope you will choose to leave it at a local newsagent, found through their website of course, rather than in the station's
