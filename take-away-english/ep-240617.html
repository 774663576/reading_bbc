     大型城市因鳞次栉比的高楼大厦而常被人们称作 “钢筋混凝土的森林”，也正因如此，大量的混凝土建材增加了城市的内涝风险。为了防治内涝，人们从大自然中汲取灵感，利用高科技手段，对城市进行 “海绵化” 改造。本文介绍城市雨洪管理概念——“海绵城市”。

     Devastating floods are becoming more and more common around the world. The warming climate is leading to heavier rainfall, but could the way that cities are growing be making things worse? Could we design cities in a different way to reduce the risk of flooding?
    </p>
    <p>
     As cities expand, and more and more land is underneath
     <strong>
      concrete
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      paving
     </strong>
     , less water is absorbed and more needs to be
     <strong>
      channelled away
     </strong>
     by
     <strong>
      storm drains
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      sewerage systems
     </strong>
     . As they become
     <strong>
      overwhelmed
     </strong>
     by the volume of water, the risk of
     <strong>
      flash flooding
     </strong>
     increases.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could it be that we've been taking the wrong approach? Chinese
     <strong>
      landscape architect
     </strong>
     Yu Kongjian certainly thinks so. In 2013, he proposed the concept of 'sponge cities', which are designed to
     <strong>
      soak up
     </strong>
     water – like a sponge – reducing the risk of sudden floods. Natural solutions are encouraged, using riverside parks and ponds to
     <strong>
      absorb
     </strong>
     <strong>
      floodwater
     </strong>
     . Approaches inspired by this have been taken by cities across the world. Auckland, in New Zealand, was named the spongiest city in one study. It has replaced the concrete
     <strong>
      culverts
     </strong>
     around the Oakley creek stream with green
     <strong>
      banks
     </strong>
     and connected parks. This has reduced flooding in the nearby residential areas as well as the amount of associated contamination which used to be
     <strong>
      washed into
     </strong>
     the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Auckland has taken a natural approach, but a much more high-tech method can be seen in Amsterdam. The Dutch city has installed
     <strong>
      blue-green roofs
     </strong>
     on a number of buildings. These roofs have a layer of plants on the outside, and then layers underneath which collect and store rainwater. This water can be used by people in the building below to water plants or flush toilets. Sophisticated software can even tell the roofs to release water ahead of upcoming storms to maximise the system's ability to soak up rainwater. It can even identify which areas of the city are at most risk and tailor the response accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yu Kongjian describes the sponge city approach as using Tai Chi with nature instead of boxing. Questions have been raised as to whether a natural approach is sufficient when faced with increased rain fall globally. What remains to be seen is whether increased scale and combination with modern technology can help natural methods save many more people from flooding.
