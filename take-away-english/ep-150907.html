     Tired of your quiet routine? How about leaving your computer games behind and taking up an
     <strong>
      extreme sport
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     You can ride a bicycle, right? In that case you're halfway to becoming a
     <strong>
      mountain biker
     </strong>
     . All you have to do is take your bike off the road and try some rough
     <strong>
      terrain
     </strong>
     . Mountain biking was developed in California in the 1970s and became an Olympic sport in 1996. In the London 2012 games athletes had to
     <strong>
      navigate
     </strong>
     a 4.7-kilometre track in less than two hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not challenging enough?
     <strong>
      Skydivers
     </strong>
     jump from aircraft at an
     <strong>
      altitude
     </strong>
     of 1,000 to 4,000 metres. You have to be
     <strong>
      fit
     </strong>
     but there's no age limit with this sport. Dilys Price from Cardiff went on her first jump aged 54. The minute she came down she wanted to go up again. "I was
     <strong>
      hooked
     </strong>
     ", said Dilys.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some
     <strong>
      adrenaline junkies
     </strong>
     are even
     <strong>
      bolder
     </strong>
     – they've invented base jumping, in which people leap from tall structures, such as buildings or bridges, with a parachute. Many of their
     <strong>
      stunts
     </strong>
     aren't legal, especially in urban areas. Dan Witchalls has jumped off The Shard - London's 310 metre-high skyscraper - four times. He says: "Base jumping is scarier than jumping out of a plane. In a plane there's no perception of height, but when you are standing on the edge of the building you can see people and cars - it makes it very real."
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems there's no lack of imagination when it comes to risking life to look cool and get the heart
     <strong>
      pounding
     </strong>
     . Surfing,
     <strong>
      scuba diving
     </strong>
     , rock climbing… How about turning one of your
     <strong>
      chores
     </strong>
     into a
     <strong>
      daredevil pursuit
     </strong>
     ? 'Extreme ironing' isn't for
     <strong>
      wimps
     </strong>
     ! Pressing your shirt on top of a mountain could be dangerous, depending on the mountain. Extreme ironing is said to have been created in the 1990s in the English town of Leicester by a man who saw a pile of
     <strong>
      wrinkled
     </strong>
     clothes and felt bored. That was Phil Shaw who also won the only Extreme Ironing Championships ever held, in Germany in 2002. For him, the
     <strong>
      thrill
     </strong>
     of this sport comes from looking at the spectators' faces. Shaw says: "Sometimes they look confused, sometimes they laugh. It's fun to see how people respond to it."
