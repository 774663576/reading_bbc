     月球是地球唯一的天然卫星。月有阴晴圆缺，不论我们肉眼是否看得见，月亮每晚都在天空升起。月亮能控制地球上的潮汐，但它也能影响生活在地球上的人类吗？本期 “随身英语” 解读月亮是否会影响人类行为的理论。

     It’s more than 384,000km from Earth. We can see it most nights. And it’s not made of cheese! I am, of course, talking about the Moon. Astronauts have taken giant steps to explore this natural
     <strong>
      satellite
     </strong>
     floating in space, but despite it being
     <strong>
      out of reach
     </strong>
     for most of us, it still moves us in
     <strong>
      mysterious
     </strong>
     ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Moon, obviously, provides
     <strong>
      moonlight
     </strong>
     . A
     <strong>
      full moon
     </strong>
     , seen roughly once a month, can light up our way on an otherwise dark night. But while this
     <strong>
      lunar
     </strong>
     light can be impressive to look at, it can affect our
     <strong>
      sleeping patterns
     </strong>
     . One study showed that during or around the full moon, those studied spent less time in
     <strong>
      deep sleep
     </strong>
     , slept for less time and reported having poorer sleep, despite sleeping in a dark room not exposed to moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many theories about how the Moon can affect other things too. One study suggested animals are more likely to bite us during a full moon. And
     <strong>
      many moons ago
     </strong>
     , it was thought the Moon induced
     <strong>
      lunacy
     </strong>
     – the word derives from the Latin word ‘lunaticus’, meaning ‘
     <strong>
      moonstruck
     </strong>
     ’, and evolved from the idea that
     <strong>
      celestial
     </strong>
     changes could cause periods of
     <strong>
      insanity
     </strong>
     . Even winemakers look to the Moon when planting and pruning grapevines. They will avoid a full moon at all costs because, although the added moisture in the soil at this time may give a fuller and juicier grape, the additional water is thought to dilute the taste of the fruit, which results in a less successful vintage.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Moon might affect our
     <strong>
      behaviour
     </strong>
     too. Writing about this for BBC Future, Claudia Hammond explains one interesting theory. Just as the Moon’s
     <strong>
      gravitational pull
     </strong>
     affects the tides, it
     <strong>
      exerts
     </strong>
     its
     <strong>
      influence
     </strong>
     on the water in our bodies. But she points out “the Moon is smaller than the Earth, so its gravitational pull is correspondingly less powerful. What’s more, it exerts the same
     <strong>
      force
     </strong>
     on us regardless of whether it’s new or full.” Research into
     <strong>
      ancient myths
     </strong>
     about the effects of the
     <strong>
      lunar cycle
     </strong>
     on us is ongoing. So, like the Moon being made of cheese, we must be careful what we believe!
