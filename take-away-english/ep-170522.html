     Imagine a future where our streets are filled with
     <strong>
      ads
     </strong>
     200m tall; where
     <strong>
      billboards
     </strong>
     change before our eyes to give us personalised messages; and where companies track our every move as we walk through a city,
     <strong>
      pinging
     </strong>
     our phones with special offers as we
     <strong>
      near
     </strong>
     their shops.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fact, all of these forms of advertising are already being tested. Let's take the first of these ideas. Back in 1982, science fiction movie Blade Runner
     <strong>
      envisaged
     </strong>
     a
     <strong>
      futuristic
     </strong>
     <strong>
      cityscape
     </strong>
     where giant adverts stretched the full height of skyscrapers. And UK company Lightvert are now doing something very similar; with one crucial difference.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of making immense physical adverts, their commercials are
     <strong>
      beamed
     </strong>
     straight into consumers' eyes. They do this by attaching a strip of reflective material onto a building and projecting an image onto it. This image then 'bounces' out into the world. When you pass directly in front of the image, you see it. It appears to be huge and suspended
     <strong>
      in mid-air
     </strong>
     , but others can't see it – it's only visible from one location. Lightvert claims this form of advertising is
     <strong>
      unobstrusive
     </strong>
     and can "unlock" large amounts of "high-value advertising
     <strong>
      real-estate
     </strong>
     ".
    </p>
    <p>
     But not everyone
     <strong>
      is sold on
     </strong>
     the idea of living in a world of endless ads. In Moscow, for example, a new form of advertising targeting
     <strong>
      motorists
     </strong>
     has split opinion. Drivers approaching a particular digital billboard in the city are shown adverts for a new kind of Jaguar car, but only if you are driving a different
     <strong>
      make
     </strong>
     of vehicle.
     <strong>
      Sensors
     </strong>
     in the billboard detect what kind of car you are driving, and send you an ad based on that information.
    </p>
    <p>
     While this may seem
     <strong>
      invasive
     </strong>
     , it's actually the saftey aspect that has concerned some observers. Researchers in Sweden have shown that digital billboards attract our eyes for longer than other kinds. In fact, they
     <strong>
      distract
     </strong>
     us for over two seconds, a length of time which studies have proved to be dangerous on the roads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, we have "
     <strong>
      proximity
     </strong>
     marketing", where shops detect where you are on the high street and send
     <strong>
      tailored
     </strong>
     adverts to your phone. Devicescape is one company trialling the use of Wi-Fi as a means of tracking customers. Their technology could work anywhere, whether in "a supermarket, a concert hall, or a bus," says Owen Geddes from their marketing team. What would customers see? "It could be a
     <strong>
      discount
     </strong>
     offer to use in the shop the person is visiting, or a piece of content such as a movie trailer," says Mr Geddes.

     1. True or false: If you are looking at a Lightvert ad, someone standing a few metres away will definitely also see it.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. Lightvert's ads are projections – not giant projections onto a wall, but tiny projections into people's eyes. If you don't stand in exactly the right place, you won't see the ad.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. According to this article, if you were driving a Jaguar car on the Moscow road, would you be shown a Jaguar ad?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      If you were driving a Jaguar, you would not see an ad for a Jaguar. Only drivers of other makes of vehicles see Jaguar ads.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Why are some people concerned about digital billboard advertising?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Some are concerned because when used on a roadside, digital billboard advertising can be dangerously distracting.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4.Which word means 'very tall buildings'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Skyscrapers.

     5. How does Devicescape follow potential customers?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Devicescape's technology follows the Wi-Fi signal on customers' mobile phones.
