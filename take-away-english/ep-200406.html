     英国人现在比以往任何时候都更需要依靠租房来解决住房问题。通常情况下，为了节省费用，不少人都选择和陌生人合租一套房子或公寓。与自己独租一个地方相比，除了节省租金以外，合租其实还有很多其它好处。当然，合租也有它的缺点。本文讨论与人合租公寓的优缺点。

     Grimy coffee cups, dirty clothes all over the floor and uninvited guests – and they're not even yours! These are the joys of flatsharing. So why do we do it? Well, for many, buying a
     <strong>
      house
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      flat
     </strong>
     is just too expensive. In fact, according to the Guardian, the total amount of
     <strong>
      rent
     </strong>
     paid by
     <strong>
      tenants
     </strong>
     in Britain in 2017 rose to more than £50 billion – more than double the level of ten years prior. And for those who do, many choose to share the place with strangers to save money. You rent a room and share the kitchen, living room and bathroom, for example. But apart from the financial saving, what are the pros and cons of flatsharing?
    </p>
    <p>
     The pros? Well, living with others means that you can pool your resources. You may not even need to ask; just leave an
     <strong>
      IOU
     </strong>
     . Then there's the fact that you gain access to their
     <strong>
      social networks
     </strong>
     . Living with people means meeting their friends, who may then become your friends. And don't forget the
     <strong>
      networking
     </strong>
     opportunity. Lastly, there's the
     <strong>
      emotional
     </strong>
     <strong>
      support
     </strong>
     . Due to the nature of
     <strong>
      communal
     </strong>
     living, you're not just dealing with your own life events, but other people's too. Most likely, there'll always be
     <strong>
      a shoulder to cry on
     </strong>
     when you need one. But don't forget to
     <strong>
      reciprocate
     </strong>
     when they need it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now the cons. There's limited
     <strong>
      storage space
     </strong>
     , for a start. In most cases, the kitchen, for example, will be
     <strong>
      divvied
     </strong>
     <strong>
      up
     </strong>
     into
     <strong>
      designated
     </strong>
     shelves and areas. Worse, many people may not respect these boundaries. You might well come home to find someone's
     <strong>
      pilfered
     </strong>
     your milk or shower gel, and no one
     <strong>
      owns
     </strong>
     <strong>
      up
     </strong>
     to it. Furthermore, despite the rota showing that cleaning is everyone's responsibility, some people don't like to
     <strong>
      pull their weight
     </strong>
     . And then there are the unexpected guests. If a
     <strong>
      flatmate
     </strong>
     forgets to
     <strong>
      keep you in the loop
     </strong>
     about a party they're throwing and all you want is a quiet night, it can be challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether the pros outweigh the cons is something everyone must decide for themselves. Some people prefer their own space, while others thrive in a social environment. Regardless, for many who lack the means to buy their own
     <strong>
      property
     </strong>
     , a flatshare is, and will continue to be, a necessity.
