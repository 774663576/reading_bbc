     Do you enjoy playing computer games? They can be
     <strong>
      thrilling
     </strong>
     , especially when you’re competing against others. They involve lots of skill, and offer a chance to
     <strong>
      switch off
     </strong>
     from the pressures of real life. But imagine if your gaming
     <strong>
      talents
     </strong>
     could actually be put to use in the real world? Well, now businesses are waking up to the skills gamers can bring to the workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
     As an example, the BBC spoke to trainee surgeon Saied Froghi. He played video games like Age of Empires and Halo in his spare time when he was at medical school. But this relaxing pastime wasn’t
     <strong>
      distracting
     </strong>
     him from his studies - he thinks his time in front of a screen actually helped his surgery skills. He claims it helped him with his
     <strong>
      concentration
     </strong>
     , and he compares some of the skills used in keyhole surgery with using a games
     <strong>
      console
     </strong>
     . He says “Your hands know where the buttons are and how to rotate the instrument.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Certainly, operating
     <strong>
      gaming controls
     </strong>
     help to develop good
     <strong>
      hand-eye coordination
     </strong>
     , but there are other abilities you can learn which can be applied to real-life work situations. Start-up company Game Academy told the BBC’s David Molloy that some games involve
     <strong>
      strategy and resource management
     </strong>
     , which are good skills for management. It analyses
     <strong>
      gamer
     </strong>
     s' habits from their online gaming
     <strong>
      profile
     </strong>
     and offers courses in valuable skills that reflect their
     <strong>
      aptitudes
     </strong>
     . These are skills that can be developed, and if carefully reworded, can be added to CVs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Employers might still need convincing that gamers are not just teenagers wasting their time in their bedrooms without thinking about their career
     <strong>
      prospects
     </strong>
     . But business consultant Mia Bennett told the BBC that gaming can help skills like "
     <strong>
      decision-making
     </strong>
     , the ability to
     <strong>
      anticipate
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      scenario planning
     </strong>
     … It also helps with
     <strong>
      meta-skills
     </strong>
     - learning how to learn, experimentation, and creative thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
     You might think that the idea of gaming developing
     <strong>
      transferable skills
     </strong>
     is like the games themselves – pure
     <strong>
      fantasy
     </strong>
     – and a gamer doesn’t want to associate the fun and escapism it provides with work. It certainly doesn’t guarantee you a good job, and you need to be an
     <strong>
      accomplished
     </strong>
     gamer for your skills to shine. But if so much time is being spent
     <strong>
      gripped
     </strong>
     by the challenge of Portal or the strategy of Civilization, why not put those talents to good use?
