     有研究显示，每年地球上可能有超过 2.7 万个物种灭绝。动物园和各类动物保护项目要如何分配用于挽救濒危动物的资源呢？调查发现，人类更倾向于保护特定动物群体，尤其是被人类视为伴侣的动物。人类的这种倾向会影响动物保护工作吗？本文就此展开讨论。

     Save the gorilla! Protect tigers! Help the giant kangaroo rats! You've probably heard the first two slogans but maybe not the last one. We're often keen to support the
     <strong>
      conservation
     </strong>
     of animals like gorillas and tigers but less sympathetic to creatures like rats. Are our stereotypes affecting which animals we choose to protect?
    </p>
    <p>
     Researchers have looked at the impact of '
     <strong>
      warmth
     </strong>
     ' – that's the perceived intentions, and '
     <strong>
      competence
     </strong>
     ' – the skill that different
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     appear to have. It's suggested that people are very keen to protect '
     <strong>
      companions
     </strong>
     ', such as dogs or monkeys, who score highly in warmth and competence. '
     <strong>
      Predators
     </strong>
     ', such as tigers or bears, score highly in competence but low in warmth. They are said to inspire
     <strong>
      awe
     </strong>
     and fear, and this means that while some people are keen to protect them, others
     <strong>
      hunt
     </strong>
     them. Animals seen as
     <strong>
      prey
     </strong>
     , like cows, rabbits, and pigs, generated more indifference, while people are prepared to actively
     <strong>
      harm
     </strong>
     those seen as low-warmth and low-competence '
     <strong>
      pests
     </strong>
     ', such as rats, mice, and fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, this might not be the full story. National Geographic Magazine asked their readers which animals were the most important to save. Four of the top five fit the companion or predator types – elephants, tigers, whales and polar bears. But the most popular animal to save was the bee. It seems that apart from
     <strong>
      concerns
     </strong>
     around warmth and competence, people are aware how species can impact the
     <strong>
      wider ecosystem
     </strong>
     and value bees as
     <strong>
      pollinators
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     According to some reports, 27,000 species are becoming
     <strong>
      extinct
     </strong>
     every year. How do zoos and conservation projects decide which animals to support? One factor is the importance of an animal to the wider ecosystem, but this can lead to some difficult choices. Phys.org reports that in Australia, koalas are much less important to the ecosystem than some lesser-known animals such as
     <strong>
      woylies
     </strong>
     . However, they also suggest a solution to this issue. To conserve cute animals, such as koalas, it's important to protect their entire
     <strong>
      habitat
     </strong>
     – and this can save a wide range of species. It could be that many animals can be
     <strong>
      sheltered
     </strong>
     by koalas' cuteness.
