     不少人提倡多吃水果和蔬菜。事实证明，吃果蔬确实有助于改善健康。专家建议每天应吃 “five-a-day（五份水果和蔬菜）”。但在日常生活中，坚持这种饮食方式容易吗？我们是否应设定一个更现实的饮食目标来保持健康？本期节目探讨英文谚语 “An apple a day keeps the doctor away. （每天一苹果，医生远离我。）” 背后的科学依据。

     We all know about the benefits of a healthy
     <strong>
      diet
     </strong>
     . '
     <strong>
      We are what we eat
     </strong>
     ', so some say. But sometimes our busy lives mean our healthy
     <strong>
      intentions
     </strong>
     slip, and we end up eating the wrong things. Messaging telling us to eat our '
     <strong>
      five-a-day
     </strong>
     ' encourages us to maintain a
     <strong>
      balanced
     </strong>
     <strong>
      diet
     </strong>
     – but is it accurate?
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're not sure what your 'five-a-day' is, it's a campaign based on advice from the World Health Organization which recommends eating a minimum of 400g of
     <strong>
      fruit
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      vegetables
     </strong>
     a day. That should lower the risk of serious health problems, such as
     <strong>
      heart disease
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      stroke
     </strong>
     and some types of
     <strong>
      cancer
     </strong>
     . Variety is important because different fruits and vegetables contain different combinations of
     <strong>
      fibre
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      vitamins
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      minerals
     </strong>
     and other
     <strong>
      nutrients
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Eating five pieces of fruit and veg is something to aim for. An analysis of 16 worldwide studies suggested that for every portion of fruit and vegetables consumed, there was a lower risk of
     <strong>
      premature
     </strong>
     death. And in the UK, previous research by the University of Oxford found around 33,000 lives a year could be saved if everyone in the UK followed
     <strong>
      dietary guidelines
     </strong>
     . Dr Peter Scarborough told the BBC: "According to our model, the biggest impact would be eating more fruit and veg. But this doesn't mean you should just stop at five – the more the better."
    </p>
    <p>
     However, there are some doubts about the 'five-a-day' message. Some fruits and vegetables are better than others. And counting orange juice, for example, as one of your portions isn't so
     <strong>
      beneficial
     </strong>
     because it contains sugar. Also, eating more vegetables than fruit tends to be better because they're richer in nutrients. Some doctors also say the message is too
     <strong>
      ambitious
     </strong>
     , and a 'two-a-day' message might be a more realistic starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
     There have been calls to up the quota to seven-a-day, but research reported in The British Medical Journal found after five portions a day, there was no further impact. But whatever fruit and vegetables you consume, every piece can help reduce the risk of
     <strong>
      cardiovascular disease
     </strong>
     and cancer. As the old saying goes: '
     <strong>
      an apple a day keeps the doctor away
     </strong>
     '.
