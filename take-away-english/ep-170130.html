     随着新型机械不断地被发明，人们对劳动密集型耕作方式的依赖在逐日减少。然而，以下这一景象会成为现实吗？农民不再需要下地干活，机器人会承包所有的工作。这是英国及世界各地的科学家们正在尝试的一个想法。

    <p>
     Imagine a future where all farming is done by machine, and humans never
     <strong>
      set foot
     </strong>
     in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     No, it’s not science fiction. In Shropshire in the UK, engineers in the Hands Free Hectare project are developing
     <strong>
      automated
     </strong>
     tractors and
     <strong>
      fleets
     </strong>
     of drones to grow and harvest crops.
    </p>
    <p>
     And their experiment is not alone: agricultural
     <strong>
      robotics
     </strong>
     is a booming
     <strong>
      sector
     </strong>
     . Investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the market will be worth $240bn over the next five years.
    </p>
    <p>
     One reason why the sector is
     <strong>
      on the up
     </strong>
     is that global demand for food is rapidly increasing. The World Bank estimates we will need to produce 50% more food by 2050 if the planet’s population continues to grow at its current speed. Add to this to the
     <strong>
      forecast
     </strong>
     that
     <strong>
      yields
     </strong>
     will decrease by over a quarter due to climate change, and the situation looks serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     Could futuristic farming provide the answer?
    </p>
    <p>
     One company in Japan believes so. The firm Spread has
     <strong>
      dispensed with
     </strong>
     farming on land altogether, and instead grows vegetables on
     <strong>
      stacks
     </strong>
     of trays indoors in an automated factory.
    </p>
    <p>
     "In countries like Japan, where land is actually a very scarce resource, it makes more sense to stack your production, just like a skyscraper," says JJ Price, Spread's global marketing manager.
    </p>
    <p>
     Mr Price told the BBC that this method of vertical farming not only reduces costs by 50%, but it is also greener.
     <strong>
      LED lights
     </strong>
     cut energy bills by a third, and 98% of water can be recycled. By growing crops close to where people consume them, transport costs and
     <strong>
      emissions
     </strong>
     are also minimised, he says. They hope to be producing 30,000 lettuces per day next year.
    </p>
    <p>
     And where will we buy this futuristic food? Perhaps in shops with no staff? Amazon has recently launched its first Amazon Go store in the US, which has no
     <strong>
      checkouts
     </strong>
     . Customers simply pick their items from the shelves, and technology does the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
     All this
     <strong>
      begs the question
     </strong>
     : if everything is automated, what jobs will people do? The
     <strong>
      mechanisation
     </strong>
     of farming means fewer and fewer people work the land. From 1950 to 2010, agricultural labourers have decreased from 81% to 48.2% of the
     <strong>
      workforce
     </strong>
     in developing countries, and from 35% to 4.2% in developed countries, according to the International Labour Organization. It’s a trend that looks set to continue.
