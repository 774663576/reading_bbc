     Everybody likes to get
     <strong>
      a freebie
     </strong>
     – something given to you to try for free. On my commute to work today I was offered a
     <strong>
      complimentary
     </strong>
     sample of washing powder and a bottle of new mineral water. Lucky me eh? Well it's not necessarily down to luck – where you can grab a freebie depends on a number of factors.
    </p>
    <p>
     For businesses, giving out something for nothing is an important
     <strong>
      marketing
     </strong>
     technique. We might not give it much thought but they are keen to see our reaction and hear our
     <strong>
      feedback
     </strong>
     and ultimately make us buy more.  But who they hear from is very crucial. They want to target the so-called
     <strong>
      trendsetters
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      influencers
     </strong>
     , in the hope that they will speak positively about the product and then sell more.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the UK, the makers of an
     <strong>
      upmarket
     </strong>
     popcorn
     <strong>
      brand
     </strong>
     gave out free packets at London's Fashion Week to
     <strong>
      create a buzz
     </strong>
     about their product by fashionable people. A spokesman said  "It's less about immediate increase in sales, and more about getting our product in the hands of people who will excitedly and personally
     <strong>
      engage
     </strong>
     <strong>
      in
     </strong>
     our brand and story."
    </p>
    <p>
     Living in a capital city certainly improves your chances of getting a freebie. Not only is the population larger but these places are often considered the trendsetter for
     <strong>
      retail
     </strong>
     purchases. So if you live in London, Paris or Beijing you'll probably see a new
     <strong>
      promotional campaign
     </strong>
     launched there first. The hope is that the fashionable city dwellers will try and like the new item and
     <strong>
      endorse
     </strong>
     it on social media. Eventually everyone around the country will know about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     How businesses give away freebies is also of interest. According to behavioural economist Enrico Trevisan, they have three different approaches: "
     <strong>
      future selling
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      cross-selling
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      up-selling
     </strong>
     ". The first is about giving something away assuming we will like it and buy more later. "With cross-selling, the company tries to gain new
     <strong>
      clients
     </strong>
     through an entrance product, with the intention of selling them additional products during their life cycle" and 'up-selling' happens when a basic version is given away for free but charges a client for more advanced and complete versions. Maybe you've experienced one of these approaches?
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course a freebie is not actually free – someone has to pay for it and this usually comes from a firm's marketing
     <strong>
      budget
     </strong>
     which is funded by the products we buy – so the expression
     <strong>
      'there's no such thing as a free lunch'
     </strong>
     could be true!
