     一项研究警告称，英国年轻人的职业理想与现有的工作类型不符。慈善机构 “教育与雇主”（Education and Employers）的研究显示，在英国，希望在艺术、文化、娱乐和体育领域工作的17岁和18岁年轻人的数量是现有工作的五倍。本文浅谈英国青年不现实的职业理想。

     What did you want to be when you were growing up? A doctor, an engineer - or maybe a footballer or actor? We all had big plans for our futures and believed there was a
     <strong>
      dream job
     </strong>
     waiting for us – one that would pay well and give great
     <strong>
      job satisfaction
     </strong>
     . But how realistic was that?
    </p>
    <p>
     Today, in the UK at least, young people are being warned that some of their career hopes and dreams don’t match the types of jobs available. Research by the charity Education and Employers suggests five times as many 17 and 18 year-olds in the UK want to work in
     <strong>
      art
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      culture
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      entertainment
     </strong>
     and sport than there are jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <strong>
      glamour
     </strong>
     and excitement of working in these
     <strong>
      employment
     </strong>
     <strong>
      sectors
     </strong>
     is obviously a
     <strong>
      draw
     </strong>
     . But those looking for these types of job will be ‘destined for disappointment’. That’s what the report, Disconnected: Career aspirations and jobs in the UK, says. Writing about this for the BBC, Katherine Sellgren points out that while young people are keen to work in art, entertainment, culture and sport, the economy is unlikely to need them all. In the meantime, there is a
     <strong>
      shortfall
     </strong>
     of young people wanting to work in careers such as
     <strong>
      catering
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      retail
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Previous research about the career
     <strong>
      aspirations
     </strong>
     of young people by the Office for National Statistics also found a ‘
     <strong>
      reality gap
     </strong>
     ’ between their dreams and the sometimes disappointing truth by the time they reached their early to late-20s. Apart from those who aimed to go into teaching, fewer than one in 50 were in the jobs they had wanted – such as a doctor, vet, firefighter or actor. Most were working as
     <strong>
      sales assistants
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      carers
     </strong>
     or in
     <strong>
      sales and marketing
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     While it’s good to have aspirations, the aims of young people need to be realistic. This latest report suggests that children need to be made more aware of a wider variety of
     <strong>
      occupations
     </strong>
     at a younger age.  It also calls for improved
     <strong>
      careers advice
     </strong>
     in secondary schools. A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions told the BBC that “early careers advice can help young people set out on the right path to the job that
     <strong>
      channels
     </strong>
     their interests and
     <strong>
      unlocks their potential
     </strong>
     .”
