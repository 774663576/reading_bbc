     罗马人在公元43年至410年间生活在英国。罗马人对英语语言的影响深远，直到今天，人们仍在使用一些由拉丁语衍变的词汇，尤其是与食物、饮品、建筑以及英国地名有关的词汇。本文介绍罗马文明对英语语言的影响。

    <p>
     The Romans lived in Britain between 43AD and 410AD but their
     <strong>
      legacy
     </strong>
     is still felt today and not just in physical
     <strong>
      ruins
     </strong>
     . The Romans left us language, including some common English words.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the Roman
     <strong>
      Empire
     </strong>
     , Latin, an
     <strong>
      ancient
     </strong>
     language, was spoken in many parts of Britain. While the Romans wrote in classical Latin, they
     <strong>
      conversed
     </strong>
     in
     <strong>
      vulgar
     </strong>
     Latin –
     <strong>
      colloquial
     </strong>
     , everyday language that was used between soldiers and in
     <strong>
      trade
     </strong>
     . Because of trade, words that
     <strong>
      stuck
     </strong>
     often relate to food and drink, such as ‘
     <strong>
      wine
     </strong>
     ’, which came from the Latin ‘vinum’. Others relate to
     <strong>
      dwellings
     </strong>
     such as ‘kitchen’, derived from the verb ‘cook’, and ‘wall’, which originally referred to a
     <strong>
      stake
     </strong>
     or post outside a
     <strong>
      fort
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Settlements
     </strong>
     and roads in Roman times were
     <strong>
      extensive
     </strong>
     . The word ‘street’, used generally as well as being used for specific names of streets, originally came from ‘strata’ which meant
     <strong>
      paved
     </strong>
     road. On a similar note, academic research from the field of linguistics indicates many well-known place names in the UK
     <strong>
      owe their origin
     </strong>
     to Latin. For example, the Romans used ‘castrum’ to refer to a city, which developed into the common place ending -chester, -caster or -cester. Consider Manchester. It is a
     <strong>
      former
     </strong>
     Roman fort which was known as Mamuciam. Other places with Roman
     <strong>
      derivations
     </strong>
     include Lancaster and Leicester.
    </p>
    <p>
     A significant impact on English which came from the Romans is the use of the Roman
     <strong>
      alphabet
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Manuscripts
     </strong>
     of Old English texts have shown a version not unalike written English today. Differences include some letters however, such as two symbols called ‘ash’ and ‘eth’. Nowadays you are more likely to see these symbols in a guide to pronunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, even though 1,600 years have passed, the Romans live on.
