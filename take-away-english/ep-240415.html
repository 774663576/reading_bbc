     数码产品在不断地更新换代。虽然数字化为日常生活提供了便利，但随着数码产品逐渐老化、数字文件格式相继被淘汰，人们可能再也无法访问曾储存在电子设备上的 “数字记忆”，从而失去了一段段宝贵的人生回忆。本文探讨有哪些方法可以更好地保护自己免受因数字科技更新换代而产生的影响。

     Having thousands of photos, songs and films available at our fingertips would have seemed amazing just a few decades ago, but how long will these files last for and be available? Could the
     <strong>
      digitalisation
     </strong>
     of cultural
     <strong>
      artefacts
     </strong>
     now be putting a time limit on our memories?
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <strong>
      materials
     </strong>
     that phones and computers are made of can
     <strong>
      decay
     </strong>
     over time, impacting the
     <strong>
      data
     </strong>
     that they store. Images can still be seen in
     <strong>
      faded
     </strong>
     photographs, but when digital data
     <strong>
      degrades
     </strong>
     , it can quickly make it impossible to even open a file.  Also, as
     <strong>
      formats
     </strong>
     and devices become
     <strong>
      obsolete
     </strong>
     , it may become impossible to read files from previous decades.
    </p>
    <p>
     Storing information in
     <strong>
      the cloud
     </strong>
     can also present problems. Large companies can still lose data. In 2019, social media platform MySpace admitted losing more than 12 years' worth of users' music
     <strong>
      uploads
     </strong>
     . The widespread use of
     <strong>
      streaming services
     </strong>
     for music, TV and film means that people no longer own the
     <strong>
      content
     </strong>
     that they watch and listen to, they just pay for the right to access it. If streaming companies decide to remove content, or
     <strong>
      go out of business
     </strong>
     , users will lose access.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Licencing
     </strong>
     rather than buying content is an example of how our behaviour towards digital content has changed. Another example is that we take far more pictures than people did in the past. This means that, added to the challenge of keeping our data safe, people have to consider what to
     <strong>
      preserve
     </strong>
     and what can be
     <strong>
      discarded
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what can we do? Technology writer Jack Schofield said that "data doesn't really exist unless you have at least two copies of it", so it's important that we keep
     <strong>
      backup
     </strong>
     <strong>
      copies
     </strong>
     of what is important to us – probably more than one. Academic Paul Royster suggests that we should all take time to consider what content we personally believe is worth saving. Perhaps the answer is just to avoid digital altogether. Science and Technology writer Chris Baranaiuk calls for a cultural movement towards buying
     <strong>
      analogue
     </strong>
     copies of cultural content.
