     市场调研机构 YouGov 替 BBC 体育电台做了一份就男性是否跳舞的调查。在参加调查的一千名男性中，有超过三成的男性说他们几乎从来没有跳过舞。导致这一现象的原因到底是男性不会跳舞，还是他们不想跳舞？本集《随身英语》探讨男性不跳舞背后可能存在的原因及鼓励男性重归舞池的方法。

    <p>
     Are men able to dance? Well, if I am an example, then no – I have
     <strong>
      two left feet
     </strong>
     and taking to the
     <strong>
      dance floor
     </strong>
     just fills me with dread. But of course, we know that most of us have the potential to
     <strong>
      throw some shapes
     </strong>
     , so what is it that's stopping us?
    </p>
    <p>
     If you've ever watched glamorous and
     <strong>
      glitzy
     </strong>
     dance shows on TV, like the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing, you'll know that there are men who have great
     <strong>
      dexterity
     </strong>
     and fancy
     <strong>
      footwork
     </strong>
     on the dancefloor. These professional dancers have spent years learning and performing ballroom dances such as the
     <strong>
      waltz
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      foxtrot
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      tango
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But for a majority of us men, we still prefer to
     <strong>
      spectate
     </strong>
     rather than participate. And according to a survey commissioned by BBC Radio 5 live, over three quarters of British men have never or rarely danced. It found that over a third of men surveyed wouldn't
     <strong>
      strut their stuff
     </strong>
     , let alone perform a
     <strong>
      paso doble
     </strong>
     , on the dancefloor because they were too embarrassed. And ten per cent said what put them off was fear of being the
     <strong>
      centre of attention
     </strong>
     , being made fun of, or being judged.
    </p>
    <p>
     Women may say we have to
     <strong>
      get a grip
     </strong>
     , get on our feet and just let ourselves go! Easier said than done. But what helps is a crowded dancefloor where there is
     <strong>
      safety in numbers
     </strong>
     . And according to the survey, many men need a drink. One man questioned said, "I don't think I'm very good at it and therefore need some
     <strong>
      Dutch courage
     </strong>
     to get me on the floor."
    </p>
    <p>
     One place where the alcohol is flowing is usually at a wedding, so, maybe unsurprisingly, the BBC survey found that 75% of men had previously danced at one. These are also the situations where partners of boyfriends and husbands can persuade them to
     <strong>
      move to the groove
     </strong>
     of the music! However, this is the time to witness some '
     <strong>
      dad dancing
     </strong>
     ' which is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as: "An awkward, unfashionable, or
     <strong>
      unrestrained
     </strong>
     style of dancing to pop music, as characteristically performed by middle-aged or older men." Surely that's not me!
    </p>
    <p>
     So let's face it, us men just need help. We need training, we need to practise and we need to lose our
     <strong>
      inhibitions
     </strong>
     . One
     <strong>
      convert
     </strong>
     , Gareth Dew, who took part in the survey, says, "I think to be able to dance you need to be able to
     <strong>
      let loose
     </strong>
     , be aware of your body and generally be more comfortable in yourself." Would you agree?
