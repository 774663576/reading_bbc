     在工作中犯错时，我们很可能会感到非常难受，甚至有时为了逃避挫折感甚至想要索性换个新工作。但实际上，通过积极并妥善地应对失误，我们便能获得一次成长的机会。本文讨论如何更好地应对我们在工作中的失误。

     That email you didn't send, the calculation you misread, the realisation that the
     <strong>
      deadline
     </strong>
     was yesterday... all followed by a
     <strong>
      sinking feeling
     </strong>
     , a
     <strong>
      quickening
     </strong>
     of the breath and the realisation that it's your
     <strong>
      fault
     </strong>
     . Fear not! Handled well, a mistake at work can become a great opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Start by
     <strong>
      owning up
     </strong>
     to it. It may be tempting to
     <strong>
      cover up
     </strong>
     a mistake, but any
     <strong>
      deception
     </strong>
     is unlikely to last for long and could delay attempts to
     <strong>
      put right
     </strong>
     the problem. And that's next – try to
     <strong>
      resolve
     </strong>
     the problems that you've created. Being
     <strong>
      proactive
     </strong>
     and coming to your manager with suggestions is likely to help you
     <strong>
      regain trust
     </strong>
     . Psychologists tell us that we tend to have a
     <strong>
      negativity bias
     </strong>
     – we are more likely to remember negative things. This is why executive coach Dina Denham Smith tells us we need to make our progress in fixing the issue clear and visible. It's also important to apologise. Showing genuine
     <strong>
      remorse
     </strong>
     demonstrates that we can
     <strong>
      take ownership
     </strong>
     of our
     <strong>
      blunders
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     As well as looking at how we
     <strong>
      make amends
     </strong>
     for our
     <strong>
      mix-ups
     </strong>
     to other people, we also need to be honest with ourselves. Removing emotion is important. Shame from making a mistake can
     <strong>
      cloud our judgement
     </strong>
     when deciding how to respond. It can also affect our
     <strong>
      perception
     </strong>
     of the mistake's seriousness – it's easy to exaggerate how bad something really is. Everyone makes mistakes. What's really important is how we
     <strong>
      address
     </strong>
     them. It's important to be
     <strong>
      reflective
     </strong>
     . Consider if there's an
     <strong>
      underlying
     </strong>
     cause for the mistake, and how to prevent future
     <strong>
      slip-ups
     </strong>
     . It can also be useful to seek advice from someone who's had similar experiences in the past. Combined with our own
     <strong>
      reflections
     </strong>
     , this can be a powerful way to grow in our job and be more successful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Academics Jasmine Virhia and Grace Lordan highlight research showing that workplaces which replace fear and blame around mistakes with opportunities for self-reflection are more psychologically safe. This allows people to learn from their mistakes, grow their skills, improve processes and ultimately productivity. Handled in the right way, by both employees and employers, mistakes can become a powerful tool for improvement.
