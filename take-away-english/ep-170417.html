     – these are some of the emotions we like
     <strong>
      to express
     </strong>
     these days when we're sending a message on our smartphones! That's why many of us now add little pictures to our texts to brighten up someones mobile screen but we're also using them as a quick way of telling someone how we're feeling. Yes,
     <strong>
      emojis
     </strong>
     have become a vital tool for communication.
    </p>
    <p>
     Let's clear one thing up first – there are emojis and emoticons. The latter are little images made using normal keys on a keyboard. For example, a colon, two dots, followed by the curved line of a close brackets is a 'smiley face'. But as technology has become more
     <strong>
      sophisticated
     </strong>
     , pre-made images have been created that can be simply added to your messages, which is great!
    </p>
    <p>
     The emoji was first invented in Japan in the late 1990s and the word 'emoji' comes from the Japanese words for 'picture' and 'character'. The number of different images has dramatically increased since then and now we have a picture for every
     <strong>
      mood
     </strong>
     or situation.
    </p>
    <p>
     So now we have the option to give this new creation the visual '
     <strong>
      thumbs-up
     </strong>
     ' but have you thought (
     <strong>
      puzzled
     </strong>
     face) why we've become so
     <strong>
      addicted
     </strong>
     to using emojis? Professor Vyv Evans, has written a book called ‘The Emoji Code’ – he says "increasingly, what we’re finding is that digital communication is taking over from certain aspects of
     <strong>
      face-to-face
     </strong>
     interaction… one of the reasons emojis are so interesting is that they really do enable us to express our emotional selves much more effectively." So emojis are a sort of
     <strong>
      substitute
     </strong>
     for the visual signals or
     <strong>
      non-verbal cues
     </strong>
     we normally give when we speak to someone face-to-face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another advantage of emojis is that they are an international language – they don't use words but tell a message in
     <strong>
      pictorial
     </strong>
     form so they can be easily
     <strong>
      interpreted
     </strong>
     whatever your native language. However, the emojis you send need some thought as they can sometimes be misinterpreted – if a friend sends you an emoji of a hammer, you may think he is angry when really he is saying he has hurt himself or he is
     <strong>
      clumsy
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     Emojis are a good way for showing
     <strong>
      empathy
     </strong>
     – they are a virtual hug or a
     <strong>
      flirtatious
     </strong>
     tease. But as linguist Neil Cohn says, "to many, emoji are an exciting evolution of the way we communicate; to others, they are
     <strong>
      linguistic Armageddon
     </strong>
     ." It does show there is a lot more to our communication than words alone but does this mean the decline in traditional writing?
