     Everyone gets tired – it's a normal part of human existence. It can make us
     <strong>
      grouchy
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      grumpy
     </strong>
     at the end of the day, but a good night's sleep will often leave us feeling
     <strong>
      well rested
     </strong>
     . However, sometimes we feel more than just general tiredness. We can get
     <strong>
      overtired
     </strong>
     and feel a bit
     <strong>
      run-down
     </strong>
     which may affect our daily lives – but what can we do about it? Here are some things that may stop you getting overtired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being very tired frequently could be the result of lifestyle choices: poor diet, lack of exercise, or an inefficient routine. For some people, changes to their habits and routines could help them to
     <strong>
      beat bouts
     </strong>
     of extreme tiredness. First, let's look at physical health. According to the UK National Health Service (NHS) website, eating healthy meals and snacks regularly, around 3-4 times per day, could improve your energy levels. Giving your body the
     <strong>
      fuel
     </strong>
     it needs could help you to be more
     <strong>
      energised
     </strong>
     , and therefore, less tired. If you're feeling overtired, you might not want to exercise. However, regular physical activity may actually mean you are less tired in general. Activities like jogging or cycling could also help you get fitter. And being more active could help you to lose weight, which can also aid you in the battle against tiredness. Those extra kilos from being overweight put a
     <strong>
      strain
     </strong>
     on your heart, which can lead to you feeling more tired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another thing that can leave us feeling
     <strong>
      weary
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      drained
     </strong>
     is stress. Reducing your stress levels may help you to feel less tired on a regular basis.
     <strong>
      Taking up
     </strong>
     an activity like yoga or going for a walk could help you to
     <strong>
      unwind
     </strong>
     and feel more
     <strong>
      refreshed
     </strong>
     . And you may think if you're feeling tired, that a good cup of coffee will
     <strong>
      perk you up
     </strong>
     . However, the Royal College of Psychiatrists recommends anyone feeling tired to
     <strong>
      cut down
     </strong>
     on their caffeine intake, especially after mid-afternoon, to get better sleep at night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, if you do find yourself feeling overtired constantly for days or weeks, you may be suffering from
     <strong>
      fatigue
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      exhaustion
     </strong>
     . If so, it could be a good idea to visit the doctor in case it's a symptom of an
     <strong>
      underlying
     </strong>
     health issue. However, for most of us, the odd day of feeling overtired might be fixed with a change in lifestyle and a few good nights' sleep.
