     智能手机和平板电脑已经成为很多家庭的常用电子产品。但与此同时，家长也开始担心孩子们使用这些电子设备对健康的影响。一项新研究称，使用屏幕给年轻人的健康造成的危害极小，所以家长们不必多虑。《随身英语》浅谈儿童使用电子设备与其健康之间的联系。

     If I could have your attention, please. I’d like to talk to you about young people’s screen time. It’s a tempting habit for them to glance at their smartphone or tablet rather than make eye contact with someone and make conversation! There is so much to look at: photographs, social media feeds, messages and emails; it’s no wonder they are
     <strong>
      glued to
     </strong>
     their screens. But is it good for them?
    </p>
    <p>
     There have been many claims about the damage looking at screens does to our
     <strong>
      eyesight
     </strong>
     . Some people feared staring at a small bright box could make us
     <strong>
      short-sighted
     </strong>
     or lead to
     <strong>
      headaches
     </strong>
     . This is a particular concern for children and young people, who spend a higher percentage of time using electronic gadgets. BBC technology correspondent, Rory Cellan-Jones, says: “there is plenty of anecdotal evidence that no matter how long teenagers are spending looking at screens, they are encountering material about issues such as
     <strong>
      anorexia
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      self-harm
     </strong>
     that could prove
     <strong>
      damaging
     </strong>
     to their
     <strong>
      mental health
     </strong>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     But a new study says time in front of computers and phones might not be as bad for young people as many think. Research by the Oxford Internet Institute examined data from more than 17,000 teenagers in the UK, Ireland and the United States. Their study concluded that most links between
     <strong>
      life satisfaction
     </strong>
     and social media use were "trivial", accounting for less than 1% of a teenager's
     <strong>
      wellbeing
     </strong>
     . Professor Przybylski, director of research at the institute, said: "99.75% of a person's life satisfaction has nothing to do with their use of social media." The research found that family, friends and school life all had a greater impact on wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, does this mean young people can spend longer looking at social media? The Oxford researchers are confident that their study is robust in its findings and that any correlation between screen time and mental health is very small. Dr Max Davie, officer for health improvement at the Royal College of
     <strong>
      Paediatrics
     </strong>
     and Child Health, calls the study a “small first step”, but he said there were other issues to explore, such as screen time's interference with other important activities like
     <strong>
      sleep
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      exercise
     </strong>
     and time with family or friends. Perhaps for now, deciding what the ‘right’ amount of screen time is has to be down to personal judgement.
