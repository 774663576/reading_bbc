    <p>
     Have you ever taken a
     <strong>
      sickie
     </strong>
     ? If so, what did you say to your boss? It seems many people in the UK like to blame their pets for their
     <strong>
      absence
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     One person said they couldn't come to work because their rabbit was missing. Perhaps that was a
     <strong>
      white lie
     </strong>
     ; this next one though sounds more like a
     <strong>
      porky
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A worker said that he couldn't come to work because he had to take his dog to the vet. This might seem reasonable - apart from the fact that the man told his boss his dog was dead as a previous excuse for
     <strong>
      skiving off
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     If you've ever worked as a teacher, you'll know that children can be very creative when it comes to excuses for not doing their homework.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once again, it's popular to blame pets. According to a BBC survey, almost 10 percent of excuses involve pets eating the
     <strong>
      assignment
     </strong>
     . "The dog ate my homework" is a
     <strong>
      legendary
     </strong>
     excuse - no one is sure if a student has ever really used it.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it's not just workplaces and schools which attract
     <strong>
      fibbers
     </strong>
     . People caught claiming
     <strong>
      welfare benefits
     </strong>
     illegally have also tried to
     <strong>
      con
     </strong>
     the authorities. A husband whose wife was working while also
     <strong>
      on the dole
     </strong>
     said that he didn't know she had a job because he was always in the
     <strong>
      garden shed
     </strong>
     during working hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many more
     <strong>
      ridiculous
     </strong>
     excuses people have made for not doing the things they were supposed to do. But there isn't enough room on this page to fit them all. And besides, I can't carry on because… the cat's eaten my keyboard. And what about you: what's your excuse?
