     In a world that favours beauty, from
     <strong>
      aesthetically pleasing
     </strong>
     interior design to an attractive physical appearance, why are we suddenly
     <strong>
      fawning over
     </strong>
     <strong>
      goofy-looking
     </strong>
     pets, particularly dogs, with
     <strong>
      exaggerated features
     </strong>
     ? There's been a pet
     <strong>
      paradigm shift
     </strong>
     – perfection is out, and
     <strong>
      droopy
     </strong>
     eyes are in. What's going on?
    </p>
    <p>
     First, we must understand our attraction to cuteness. Human babies are pretty helpless, so there had to be an evolutionary adaptation to ensure we looked after them. According to Konrad Lorenz's "baby schema" theory,
     <strong>
      infantile
     </strong>
     features like big eyes, big heads and soft bodies trigger the instinct to protect our offspring. When animals have similar traits, we think they're "in need of our companionship or care," causing "the rush of warm emotion that is the
     <strong>
      cuteness response
     </strong>
     ," says Joshua Dale, co-editor of 'The Aesthetics and Affects of Cuteness'.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the Victorian era, dog shows were
     <strong>
      all the rage
     </strong>
     , and with them came
     <strong>
      selective breeding
     </strong>
     for cuteness rather than health or functionality. This led to a rise in
     <strong>
      flat-faced
     </strong>
     breeds with
     <strong>
      squashed snouts
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      bulging
     </strong>
     eyes like bulldogs and pugs - a reminder that
     <strong>
      beauty is in the eye of the beholder
     </strong>
     . These breeds remain very popular today. The French Bulldog became the most popular dog in the US in 2022, according to the American Kennel Club. Rowena Parker, lecturer at the Royal Veterinary College in the UK, believes this is partly driven by social media influencers. "
     <strong>
      The ugly-cute thing
     </strong>
     is very fashionable," she says. Despite the growing love for these dogs, there are ethical concerns. Many flat-faced breeds suffer from breathing difficulties and skin infections.
    </p>
    <p>
     A testament to the pet paradigm shift is the World's Ugliest Dog Contest, held in California since the 1970s. In a line-up of pooches with
     <strong>
      lopsided
     </strong>
     ears,
     <strong>
      snaggled
     </strong>
     <strong>
      teeth
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      patchy
     </strong>
     fur, who will be the loveable
     <strong>
      underdog
     </strong>
     that
     <strong>
      tugs on our heartstrings
     </strong>
     this year?
