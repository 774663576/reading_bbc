     你的床是安全的吗？当你躺下来的时候，你会出现眼睛流泪，打喷嚏或者咳嗽的状况吗？如果有，那么你可能对空气中的灰尘有过敏性反应。这些灰尘包含着各种微小的细菌、真菌及尘螨，许多都生活在我们的床上。当我们在睡眠中翻身时，它们就会被惊动，然后可能被吸入人体。定期给床垫吸尘是一种减少床上微生物的办法，还有其它什么建议呢？请看本期《随身英语》。

     Do you consider your bed a safe
     <strong>
      haven
     </strong>
     of rest and calm? Do you sink into a mattress after a hard day's work and feel tension and stress drain away as you rest your
     <strong>
      weary
     </strong>
     head on a soft pillow? Well, you might not feel so relaxed if you knew that
     <strong>
      microscopic
     </strong>
     <strong>
      pests
     </strong>
     were
     <strong>
      lurking
     </strong>
     there! It seems that beds may not be such a good place for our
     <strong>
      well-being
     </strong>
     – they could actually be making us ill!
    </p>
    <p>
     Recent studies have shown that bacteria, fungi and dust
     <strong>
      mites
     </strong>
     , some smaller than the diameter of a hair, live in our
     <strong>
      bedding
     </strong>
     . When we move around in our sleep, we disturb them and they are
     <strong>
      propelled
     </strong>
     into the air – which we then breathe in as we sleep. According to the American Lung Association, four out of five households in the United States now have high levels of dust mites, although it's not the mites themselves that cause the problems, but their droppings. These are "highly
     <strong>
      allergenic
     </strong>
     " according to Dr William Berger, a fellow with the American Academy of Allergy,
     <strong>
      Asthma
     </strong>
     and Immunology. "Even if you aren't allergic… they can still irritate you, the way pepper would if it blew into your nose and eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
     Brendan Boor, Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering, who carries out bed research, also found that bed dust in the air
     <strong>
      triggers
     </strong>
     allergies – causing watery eyes, sneezing, coughs and asthma. He has recommended ways to limit our
     <strong>
      exposure
     </strong>
     to these unsavoury allergens:
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, he suggests vacuuming your mattress regularly – weekly, or even daily. He also recommends doing away with carpets and washing floors. Using allergen-
     <strong>
      proof
     </strong>
     bed covers, he says, can reduce the risk of getting allergies. In addition, washing bedding and pillows frequently can help, as can a portable air cleaner placed near the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you do as Brendan Boor suggests, you will breathe in cleaner air as you sleep… or will you? Is it really safe for you to go back in your bed…?
