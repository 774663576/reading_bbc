     For many of us, the relationship we have with sugar is love at first taste, and that love usually lasts a lifetime. But what price do we have to pay for this truly addictive,
     <strong>
      sugary
     </strong>
     love?
     <strong>
      Rotten
     </strong>
     teeth? Heavier bodies? Raised
     <strong>
      blood sugar levels
     </strong>
     ? Or even
     <strong>
      type 2 diabetes
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Time to quit perhaps? Easier said than done. What’s the alternative? Many would suggest using sweeteners as a
     <strong>
      substitute
     </strong>
     . But are sweeteners healthier than sugar?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sweeteners are usually
     <strong>
      low-calorie
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      calorie-free
     </strong>
     substances that have a similar taste to sugar. It is estimated that more than a quarter of British households buy
     <strong>
      artificial sweeteners
     </strong>
     to help
     <strong>
      cut their sugar intake
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has approved some of the
     <strong>
      health claims
     </strong>
     food manufacturers have made about sweeteners such as
     <strong>
      xylitol
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      sorbitol
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      sucralose
     </strong>
     . These include preventing
     <strong>
      tooth decay
     </strong>
     and controlling blood sugar levels.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the National Health Service in the UK, sweeteners are safe to use and are especially helpful for those who are
     <strong>
      diabetic
     </strong>
     . Sioned Quirke, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association says, “As a dietician, I support and promote the use of sweeteners in cooking and diet." She also says that "There is no evidence to suggest that low-calorie sweeteners, such as saccharin,
     <strong>
      aspartame
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      sucralose
     </strong>
     , are harmful or bad for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But many have concerns over the long-term effects caused by using sweeteners.  Dr Robert Lustig, author of 'Fat Chance: The Bitter Truth About Sugar' would not
     <strong>
      endorse
     </strong>
     sweeteners as an alternative to sugar because, “We have a
     <strong>
      dearth
     </strong>
     of data”. According to Dr Lustig, organisations like EFSA only require studies which test if something will poison a person in a short period of time, otherwise known as
     <strong>
      acute toxicity
     </strong>
     studies. But we still don’t know what the long-term effects are.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dietician Emma Carder says on the NHS Choices website, “While more research is needed, sweeteners continue to have a useful role in offering a sweet taste without adding extra calories.”
