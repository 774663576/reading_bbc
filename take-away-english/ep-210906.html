     From a young age, many of us learn the benefits of being an extrovert – those
     <strong>
      gregarious
     </strong>
     individuals who always seem to be the
     <strong>
      life and soul of the party
     </strong>
     , often
     <strong>
      outspoken
     </strong>
     and able to express their opinions easily. However, not all of us are wired that way – so is being an extrovert really better?
    </p>
    <p>
     While thinking of extroverts, we imagine a character who is
     <strong>
      assertive
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      approachable
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      cheerful
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      charming
     </strong>
     . We are taught to admire these
     <strong>
      traits
     </strong>
     early on. Kids are often
     <strong>
      encouraged
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      interact
     </strong>
     , play and
     <strong>
      communicate
     </strong>
     with other children. It seems at times as though children are made to embrace a more
     <strong>
      outgoing
     </strong>
     lifestyle, with some people becoming pseudo-extroverts – introverts who
     <strong>
      mimic
     </strong>
     extrovert behaviour. While externally they may seem to enjoy the company of others, or being in the limelight, they can still become
     <strong>
      over-extended
     </strong>
     in intense social situations.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while the positive aspects of being an extrovert are plain to see, what are the benefits of introversion? While extroverts thrive on social interaction, introverts are more comfortable with levels of isolation. According to Dr Berit Brogaard, a professor of philosophy, extreme
     <strong>
      solitude
     </strong>
     , such as times like the recent lockdown, does not affect introverts as much as extroverts. Lack of social contact, something extroverts thrive on, can lead to depression, loneliness, and even premature death.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it’s not just in an extreme situation that the pros of being an introvert shine through. These people seem to have more time for
     <strong>
      contemplation
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      introspection
     </strong>
     and thus can become more balanced. They also tend to be good listeners and think before they speak, meaning they could become great friends. Finally, introverts are often fantastic observers, as sitting out of the focus can give you more time to watch the behaviour of others.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, whatever your personality, either introvert or extrovert, there are clear advantages to being either, and if you meet an introvert, you might just end up with an amazing friend.
