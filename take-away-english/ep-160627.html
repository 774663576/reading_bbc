      词汇: aging 老龄化

    <p>
     When is it time to slow down? Is it when you reach
     <strong>
      middle age
     </strong>
     , when you can
     <strong>
      draw your pension
     </strong>
     or even later? Queen Elizabeth II turned 90 this year and there are not many signs that she's
     <strong>
      taking it easy
     </strong>
     . Last year alone the monarch carried out over 300 engagements.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Longevity
     </strong>
     has long been a topic of discussion in Britain. What's likely to make us live longer? According to Professor Sarah Harper, from the Oxford Institute of Population
     <strong>
      Ageing
     </strong>
     , just over half your
     <strong>
      chances
     </strong>
     of living a long life come down to luck. She says: "If you have parents and grandparents who made it into their eighties and nineties there's a chance you have
     <strong>
      inherited
     </strong>
     good genes. You are more likely to have a strong
     <strong>
      immune system
     </strong>
     and are less likely to develop
     <strong>
      chronic diseases
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Lucky you, then. But don't rely on that because
     <strong>
      bad habits
     </strong>
     can spoil everything. Half of long-term smokers die
     <strong>
      prematurely
     </strong>
     . Smoking causes heart disease, lung cancer and other illnesses. A poor diet and lack of exercise can lead to obesity, which reduces your
     <strong>
      life expectancy
     </strong>
     by between three and 10 years, says the National Health Service in Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it's not worth stressing out about how long you're going
     <strong>
      to stick around
     </strong>
     . Stress can take years off someone's life. A study published in the British Medical Journal found even low-level stress raises the risk of heart attacks and
     <strong>
      strokes
     </strong>
     by 20% and you don't want that, do you?
    </p>
    <p>
     After you've
     <strong>
      ticked all the boxes
     </strong>
     - genes, healthy living,
     <strong>
      keeping cool
     </strong>
     - you might have almost guaranteed a long life. But for what? That's the final piece of the
     <strong>
      jigsaw
     </strong>
     . Having a purpose in life can also make you live longer. Some people engage in
     <strong>
      charity work
     </strong>
     to keep active, others get involved in initiatives in their community. It gives them a reason to wake up in the morning - even if the joints creak a little. Professor Harper says that caring for others can make you feel valued.
    </p>
    <p>
     It must feel good to be appreciated – by people around you, by a nation. Happy 90th birthday, Your Majesty!
