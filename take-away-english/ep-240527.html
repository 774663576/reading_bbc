     大家都知道运动可以强身健体。健身房也因此成为了很多现代人做运动的理想去处。然而，健身房里是否存在健康隐患？比如健身器材的卫生问题，在他人目光注视下锻炼时产生的焦虑情绪，以及过量训练给身体带来的伤害。本文围绕去健身房锻炼时需要关注的健康隐患展开讨论。

     150 minutes of exercise a week: that's how much we should all be doing. Does this mean that gyms are the best ways to guarantee our health? Maybe, but they are not without their own
     <strong>
      health risks
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Recent studies have suggested that some
     <strong>
      gym-goers
     </strong>
     ' hygiene standards leave much to be desired. Bacteria that can cause serious illness, such as food poisoning or pneumonia, was found on the surface of gym equipment.
     <strong>
      Sweat
     </strong>
     and the increased temperature caused by exercise can help dangerous bacteria grow on the skin, which can be transferred to our clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     It might not just be the microbes at a gym that could be toxic. Toxic gym culture may be leading people to feel
     <strong>
      judged
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      intimidated
     </strong>
     . In a 2019 US study, over half those surveyed felt
     <strong>
      anxious
     </strong>
     when going to the gym.
    </p>
    <p>
     This feeling of being judged, and an overly
     <strong>
      competitive
     </strong>
     atmosphere, could create pressure to
     <strong>
      over-exercise
     </strong>
     . The Cleveland Clinic distinguishes between
     <strong>
      overreaching
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      over-training
     </strong>
     . The first is the result of a single instance of
     <strong>
      over-exertion
     </strong>
     , which leads to little more than
     <strong>
      muscle soreness
     </strong>
     , while the latter is more long-term and can have more serious consequences. Over-training has been linked to
     <strong>
      injuries
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      fatigue
     </strong>
     , reduced appetite and problems with sleep or
     <strong>
      weight gain
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     When exercise becomes a
     <strong>
      compulsion
     </strong>
     , it can also be dangerous for our mental health. Writing for CNET, wellness writer Taylor Leamey warns that feeling guilt at missed gym sessions or trying to use exercise as a way to control our bodies could be signs that
     <strong>
      exercise dependency
     </strong>
     is a problem. This can be linked with having a
     <strong>
      negative body image
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, we shouldn't forget that exercise can really help our physical and mental health, as long as we can maintain a healthy relationship with it.
