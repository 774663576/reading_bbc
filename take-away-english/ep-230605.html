      词汇：relaxing sounds 令人放松的声音
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     In a fast-paced world, where stress and mental fatigue seem commonplace, we're constantly looking for new ways to
     <strong>
      unwind
     </strong>
     . Some people take a hot bath, watch a film, go for a run, or listen to slower
     <strong>
      tempo
     </strong>
     music to help them relax. But what about the
     <strong>
      chirrups
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      whistles
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      birdsong
     </strong>
     or other nature sounds? Could they also help people to let go of the tensions of modern life?
    </p>
    <p>
     According to a study by King's College London in 2022, seeing or hearing birds could help to boost the mental
     <strong>
      wellbeing
     </strong>
     of people. Taking a trip to a place rich in
     <strong>
      birdlife
     </strong>
     like parks, forests and canals and encountering birds
     <strong>
      chirping
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      warbling
     </strong>
     to each other in the trees could even help to treat some mental health conditions. And it's not just birds that could have a
     <strong>
      therapeutic
     </strong>
     effect on our moods. Another study commissioned by the National Trust compared the effects of
     <strong>
      woodland
     </strong>
     sounds with voiced meditation apps. The study found listening to birdsong as well as other woodland sounds like leaves
     <strong>
      crunching
     </strong>
     underfoot or the gentle
     <strong>
      trickle
     </strong>
     of a stream boosted feelings of relaxation 30% more than an app. Other sounds which may help to
     <strong>
      chill
     </strong>
     people
     <strong>
      out
     </strong>
     are
     <strong>
      waves
     </strong>
     <strong>
      lapping
     </strong>
     on the
     <strong>
      shore
     </strong>
     , gentle
     <strong>
      breezes
     </strong>
     , and light
     <strong>
      rainfall
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However, not all of us live in
     <strong>
      rural
     </strong>
     surroundings, and depending on where we live, a trip to the countryside to see birds may not be an option. But could the nature sounds that originate there still help you? According to research by California Polytechnic State University, even a recording of the sounds of birds had a profound effect on people's mood, while other studies saw people listening to
     <strong>
      soundscapes
     </strong>
     of the coast and forests with similar outcomes to their wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, wherever you live, you can access the wonderful sounds of birds and nature, be it during a stroll through a wood or via some headphones. And maybe listening to the chirps,
     <strong>
      trills
     </strong>
     , warbles and whistles of some birds could help you to relax after a long, hard day.
