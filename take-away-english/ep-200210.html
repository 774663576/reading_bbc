     “你为什么不回到故乡去看看呢?”——这是 “寻根游” 背后的理念。这一最新旅游趋势是基于越来越多的人希望通过研究他们的DNA来了解自己的过去，追寻祖先的足迹。许多人选择追景溯源，以追寻家族史为目的，访问他们的祖先曾经生活过的地方。“随身英语” 介绍 “寻根游”。

     Everyone loves a holiday! A little
     <strong>
      time off
     </strong>
     for some much-needed
     <strong>
      R &amp; R
     </strong>
     can be exactly the thing to
     <strong>
      rejuvenate
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      refresh
     </strong>
     . That said, if you're struggling to think of your next
     <strong>
      destination
     </strong>
     then look no further. Don't waste time debating, let your
     <strong>
      blood
     </strong>
     decide.
    </p>
    <p>
     Everybody has a
     <strong>
      lineage
     </strong>
     . Recently, finding out more about our family origins has become popular. By the start of 2019, 26 million people had taken an
     <strong>
      ancestry
     </strong>
     DNA test at home, according to a report by MIT Technology Review. They believe by 2021 this number will have risen to 100 million.
    </p>
    <p>
     This trend has been noticed by opportunistic
     <strong>
      travel operators
     </strong>
     . Some are looking to provide a service that both allows people to trace their
     <strong>
      heritage
     </strong>
     - by literally going back to their
     <strong>
      roots
     </strong>
     - and travel to the destinations where their ancestors
     <strong>
      originated
     </strong>
     from.
    </p>
    <p>
     Airbnb, an online lodging marketplace, recently partnered with 23andMe, a DNA testing and analysis company, to offer recommendations that encourage travellers to
     <strong>
      walk in the footsteps
     </strong>
     of their
     <strong>
      forefathers
     </strong>
     . And they aren't the only ones.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Shelbourne hotel in Dublin has its own '
     <strong>
      genealogy
     </strong>
     butler'. Hellen Kelly offers consultations to help guests
     <strong>
      trace
     </strong>
     their Irish
     <strong>
      line of descent
     </strong>
     using official records. This allows them to '
     <strong>
      fill in the blanks
     </strong>
     of their Irish ancestry', she told Good Morning America.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Conte Club, a luxury travel company, offers custom
     <strong>
      itineraries
     </strong>
     based on DNA tests. 'These experiences are about
     <strong>
      delving
     </strong>
     deeper into who we really are,' says Conte Club CEO Rebecca Fielding in an article in the Condé Nast Traveller. 'It might be the most meaningful trip we can take.'
    </p>
    <p>
     So next time you think of going on vacation, why not take a DNA test first? Once you know how far your family has come, take the time to holiday back.
