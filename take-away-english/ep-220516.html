      词汇: journalling 写日记
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     For many of us, a
     <strong>
      work diary
     </strong>
     is a practical thing. We use them for work to
     <strong>
      make a note
     </strong>
     of appointments or meetings,
     <strong>
      scribbling
     </strong>
     words next to dates to remind us of something we have to do in the future. But journalling is more about feelings. It’s a
     <strong>
      personal diary
     </strong>
     , often kept far from
     <strong>
      prying eyes
     </strong>
     , sometimes
     <strong>
      detailing
     </strong>
     our secrets and desires. But, when it comes to feelings, what are the benefits to
     <strong>
      writing things down
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes it can be difficult to say exactly what we’re feeling. Because of anxiety or frustration, it can be tricky to
     <strong>
      put
     </strong>
     your problems
     <strong>
      into words
     </strong>
     . For some of us,
     <strong>
      putting pen to paper
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      jotting down
     </strong>
     our thoughts is a much easier process than saying them. But it’s not just about the ease of
     <strong>
      scrawling
     </strong>
     words. Writing things down can actually help us to
     <strong>
      formulate
     </strong>
     ideas,
     <strong>
      consolidate
     </strong>
     emotions, and understand our feelings. There’s something
     <strong>
      cathartic
     </strong>
     about making sense of something that is stressing us, annoying us, or getting us down. Writing a narrative of events or a series of words about what is on your mind can help you to focus, and is comparable to a form of meditation. And journalling isn’t just limited to words. Why not include
     <strong>
      squiggles
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      doodles
     </strong>
     or pictures of what’s happening in your life? Maybe the thing that is annoying you most could be best summed up by a
     <strong>
      caricature
     </strong>
     . In short, journalling is good for your mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another thing to consider is that our memories fade over time. What is clear in our minds today may just be forgotten a few years down the line.
     <strong>
      Logging
     </strong>
     what’s happening in our lives could
     <strong>
      trigger
     </strong>
     memories when we read our diary entries back in years to come, or could act as an
     <strong>
      insight
     </strong>
     into our past selves. We can see our development, or be reminded of exciting
     <strong>
      flashpoints
     </strong>
     in our lives. The person who was annoying us and you drew a doodle of five years ago may now be a close friend, or something that you were once scared of may now seem funny.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you have something on your mind, it might be good to get things written down. And if something exciting happens, writing about it may help you to remember that wonderful time!
