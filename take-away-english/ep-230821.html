     同一道美食在不同的地方可能会有不同的做法。但有些人认为，一道菜一定要原汁原味才行，如果听说了某家餐厅的饭菜 “不够正宗”，就会避而远之。本期节目探讨为什么人们在谈论食物时强调正宗，以及 “正宗” 的定义到底是什么。

    <p>
     As a result of trade, travel and migration, different
     <strong>
      cuisines
     </strong>
     have spread across the world. Many
     <strong>
      recipes
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      chefs
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      restaurants
     </strong>
     try to claim that their example of a particular
     <strong>
      culinary tradition
     </strong>
     is the most authentic. But is this a good thing?
    </p>
    <p>
     People care about authenticity because
     <strong>
      food traditions
     </strong>
     are closely linked to identity, particularly for migrant communities. Sociologist and professor of
     <strong>
      food studies
     </strong>
     , Krishnendu Ray, explains that
     <strong>
      home cooking
     </strong>
     is often the last way that communities can show their identity. British
     <strong>
      celebrity chef
     </strong>
     Jamie Oliver was accused of trying to take advantage of positive feelings about Jamaica. His
     <strong>
      ready meal
     </strong>
     product had a Jamaican name, but was unlike genuine Jamaican
     <strong>
      cooking
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However, food consultant Sara Kay asks whether there are problems with the idea of authenticity. She highlights that these ideas often come from the expectations that majority cultures have about minority cultures and their food. These can be restricting –
     <strong>
      restauranteurs
     </strong>
     have complained that people expect Asian food to be cheaper than that from European cultures.
    </p>
    <p>
     Expectations can also give people a false idea of what is authentic. While large cities are full of
     <strong>
      eateries
     </strong>
     representing different countries – China, India, Italy, Mexico and more – these labels can oversimplify the reality of food from these countries. Stephanie Elizondo Greist was surprised by the difference between
     <strong>
      regional specialities
     </strong>
     in different parts of Mexico and what she ate growing up as a Mexican-American in Texas, but feels that both are authentic examples of Mexican food.
    </p>
    <p>
     A more controversial view of authenticity was stated by American Chef Andrew Zimmern, who claimed that he could bring Chinese
     <strong>
      dishes
     </strong>
     to Minnesota in a more authentic way than existing restaurants – many of which are owned by Chinese-Americans. Writer and food podcaster Ruth Tam points out that while these restaurants altered their
     <strong>
      menus
     </strong>
     to suit local tastes, so does Zimmern. So, while food and identity are closely linked, and failure to respect authenticity can cause offence, could there be problems with the whole idea of authenticity?
