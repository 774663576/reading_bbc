      词汇: Procrastination 拖延
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Do you ever have a
     <strong>
      task
     </strong>
     you need to complete but however urgent it may be, you just don't get on and do it? From doing the housework to writing an assignment, there's always something I can
     <strong>
      put off
     </strong>
     until tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being a
     <strong>
      procrastinator
     </strong>
     is quite easy. There are so many other more interesting
     <strong>
      distractions
     </strong>
     such as watching funny cat videos on the internet or catching up with friends on social media! But Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, once wisely said that: 'You may delay, but time will not', in other words, the time we waste now is gone forever – so maybe I should
     <strong>
      pull my socks up
     </strong>
     and get on with what I should be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The reason why many of us delay doing something is that we
     <strong>
      live for the present
     </strong>
     not the future. We are
     <strong>
      reluctant
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     <strong>
      engage
     </strong>
     in tasks that relate to the future – sorting something out now that will benefit us in the future doesn't seem like a
     <strong>
      priority
     </strong>
     . Daphna Oyserman, Professor of Psychology at the University of Southern California, says that "many things that are quite important about the future require that we start doing things now rather than waiting for later to happen ... waiting till later means that we won't have much time." So get on with it now rather than have a
     <strong>
      last-minute
     </strong>
     panic later!
    </p>
    <p>
     But it's hard
     <strong>
      to muster
     </strong>
     any enthusiasm when there are tedious chores to be done, so how can I control my lack of focus and
     <strong>
      knuckle down
     </strong>
     to what really needs to be done? One idea is
     <strong>
      temptation bundling
     </strong>
     – doing two activities together – one that is boring but essential and one that you enjoy but isn't so
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     . Planning is essential too and we should never
     <strong>
      underestimate
     </strong>
     how long things will take us. However, Dr Catherine Loveday from Westminster University warns us about a 'planning
     <strong>
      fallacy
     </strong>
     ' thinking we can get something done quickly. She says "We never seem to get any better at judging time in the future and how long things will take us."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe for now, I'll make a cup of tea, and
     <strong>
      ponder
     </strong>
     on these thoughts before I
     <strong>
      crack on
     </strong>
     with some important tasks – anyway, there's always tomorrow.
