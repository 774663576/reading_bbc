     如今，人们越来越重视工作与生活之间的平衡。同时，新科技的推出为居家办公提供了更多便利。在英国，一种支持员工灵活选择办公地点的混合工作制正逐步成型。本期 “随身英语” 节目探讨这种新的工作方式对员工和雇主来说意味着什么。

     For many, the idea of
     <strong>
      commuting
     </strong>
     daily to a place of work might sound outdated. In the UK, at least, the shape of the working week is changing, and a new
     <strong>
      hybrid
     </strong>
     approach is becoming commonplace. This new look seems inevitable: new technology means
     <strong>
      tasks
     </strong>
     traditionally done in the office can be done at home. And there's the demand for a better
     <strong>
      work-life balance
     </strong>
     , too. All of this has been accelerated by the necessary changes brought on by the Covid pandemic.
    </p>
    <p>
     One obvious change in the UK is that Friday has become the most popular day to work from home. One survey found it's when just 13% of
     <strong>
      workers
     </strong>
     go into the office. It means
     <strong>
      employees
     </strong>
     can save on commuting costs and the price of lunches. And Claire McCartney from The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development told the BBC that generally
     <strong>
      employers
     </strong>
     thought the shift to hybrid working and home working had "increased
     <strong>
      productivity
     </strong>
     rather than decreased it".
    </p>
    <p>
     Monday is also becoming a '
     <strong>
      work from home
     </strong>
     ' day: a recent study of mobile phone activity in the UK suggested a typical week in the office now runs from Tuesday to Thursday. This means
     <strong>
      companies
     </strong>
     have to think differently about the
     <strong>
      workspace
     </strong>
     they provide. Mark Allan, chief executive of property firm LandSec, told the BBC: "We certainly believe there are going to be fewer people in offices for the longer term, and we are planning accordingly." A shorter office week isn't great news for the city-centre shops, which depend on trade from workers. But
     <strong>
      suburban
     </strong>
     and small-town high streets are reporting an increase in
     <strong>
      footfall
     </strong>
     as people work and shop locally.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's also an emerging trend for a shorter working week. Some companies are experimenting with a four-day working week – but with the same full-time
     <strong>
      pay
     </strong>
     . They have tried to make work time more
     <strong>
      efficient
     </strong>
     by cutting out unnecessary meetings and having shorter breaks, for example. They claim this has made workers more
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     . All this makes you wonder if the act of going to work and doing
     <strong>
      the nine-to-five
     </strong>
     will become a thing of the past.
