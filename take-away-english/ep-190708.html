     尽管英国人每周工作的时间很长，但他们的工作效率却低于许多其它欧洲国家。有一种方法或许可以解决这个问题 —— 那就是缩短工作时间。一周工作四天意味着大家可以有额外的一个休息日，但仍拿五天的工资。目前，英国已经有公司开始实行一周四天工作日的制度。不过，对于这个制度是否可行，人们意见不一。你认为 “每周四天工作日” 的制度可行吗？本集 “随身英语” 讨论缩短工作周的利弊。

     People in the UK work longer hours than anyone else in the European Union but are far from the most
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     . According to the
     <strong>
      Trades
     </strong>
     <strong>
      Union
     </strong>
     Congress, a UK body that brings together 49 member unions to improve their
     <strong>
      working conditions
     </strong>
     , employees in Denmark are 24% more productive per hour but work four hours fewer per week. 'Britain's
     <strong>
      long-hours culture
     </strong>
     … is robbing workers of a decent home life and time with their loved ones.
     <strong>
      Overwork
     </strong>
     , stress and exhaustion have become the new normal,' says TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady. They want businesses to cut the
     <strong>
      standard working week
     </strong>
     from five days to four. But would a four-day week work?
    </p>
    <p>
     It does for Rich Leigh,
     <strong>
      founder
     </strong>
     of a Gloucester-based PR business.
     <strong>
      Staff
     </strong>
     there work Monday to Thursday, 9am – 5:30pm, but still get paid the same as before. In an interview with the BBC, Leigh claims it makes the staff happier, which leads to better, more productive work. After a year,
     <strong>
      earnings
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      profits
     </strong>
     are up and
     <strong>
      sick days
     </strong>
     have halved.
    </p>
    <p>
     The 4 Day Week Campaign also believes a shorter week would benefit everyone. They claim that it would, among other things, more evenly distribute work between the overworked and the
     <strong>
      underemployed.
     </strong>
     They estimate that around 30 UK businesses
     <strong>
      operate
     </strong>
     a 'four day, same pay' system.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, not everyone is convinced. One of the UK's leading charities, the Wellcome Trust, conducted an
     <strong>
      organisation
     </strong>
     -wide consultation into whether a four-day week would fit. They decided against it. 'Many employees worried about their five-day
     <strong>
      workloads
     </strong>
     being compressed into just four days and some raised concerns that the time and energy used to implement a four-day week would distract the charity from its
     <strong>
      core work
     </strong>
     ,' says Ed Whiting, director of policy at the Trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     So does a four-day working week work or not? Clearly it suits some… but not everyone. "We've got a lot to do before it can work for different
     <strong>
      sectors
     </strong>
     ," says Emelia Quist from the Federation of Small Businesses in a BBC interview. 'Social care needs people present
     <strong>
      24/7
     </strong>
     . How can we ensure those
     <strong>
      industries
     </strong>
     can work a four-day week?' she adds. Until we can answer questions like these, there's clearly more work to be done.
