    <p>
     I’ll let you into a secret. There’s a place that gets me every time: whenever I’m there,
     <strong>
      I can’t help but
     </strong>
     <strong>
      well up
     </strong>
     . Where is this tear-inducing location? It’s thousands of metres high in the sky, in the
     <strong>
      cabin
     </strong>
     of an aeroplane. Especially when there’s a
     <strong>
      trashy
     </strong>
     romantic comedy on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why am I admitting this now? Because apparently, I’m not alone. English
     <strong>
      crooner
     </strong>
     Ed Sheeran confesses to getting all emotional when flying too. And
     <strong>
      get this
     </strong>
     : a survey carried out by Gatwick Airport in London found that 15% of men confess they’re more likely to cry during films in planes than watching at home. And 41% of men owned up to
     <strong>
      burying
     </strong>
     themselves in the blankets to hide their tears in a separate survey by Virgin Atlantic. In all, 55% of air travellers in the Virgin study claimed they experience
     <strong>
      heightened emotions
     </strong>
     when flying.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what’s going on? How does air travel
     <strong>
      tap into
     </strong>
     our hidden emotions? A study from the Netherlands has shown adults cry due to feelings of separation, loneliness or powerlessness. All of these are easily experienced when flying: you’re far from family, often alone, and have no control over the aircraft’s flight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another theory relates to the lack of distraction. When you’re strapped into your seat in a sealed cabin in the sky, there’s not a lot you can do. So we are able to
     <strong>
      invest
     </strong>
     ourselves more fully into the movies we watch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then there’s the physical space. Air pressure and oxygen levels are lower, and this can affect our mental state. Conditions in an aeroplane resemble those at an
     <strong>
      altitude
     </strong>
     of 2,400m. The reduced oxygen at this height can affect the brain. According to a study by the US Institute of Medicine: “the initial mood experienced at altitude is
     <strong>
      euphoria
     </strong>
     , followed by depression.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And what about the movies themselves? Virgin say top
     <strong>
      culprits
     </strong>
     include
     <strong>
      tearjerkers
     </strong>
     such as Billy Elliot, Eat Pray Love and, at number one position, Toy Story 3. Their emotional
     <strong>
      firepower
     </strong>
     even caused the aeroplane to slap
     <strong>
      tongue-in-cheek
     </strong>
     “emotional health warnings” on select movies back in 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
     Virgin Atlantic film critic Jason Solomons said at the time, "On a flight, we're
     <strong>
      isolated
     </strong>
     , leaving loved ones or aching to be reunited with them. We're nervous, we're tired, we might have had a drink at a time we usually wouldn't, and if we see an image, a scene that reflects our
     <strong>
      emotional state
     </strong>
     , frankly we're
     <strong>
      suckers
     </strong>
     . Flying and films is a heady
     <strong>
      cocktail
     </strong>
     .

    <p>
     1. Where does the author always cry?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The author always cries when in an aeroplane, especially when watching trashy movies.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. True or false:
     <em>
      men cry 41% more often when in planes.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. The 41% figure refers to the number of men who hide their crying. We don’t know the percentage who cry more often in general, but those who cry more often when watching films is 15%.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Why does the brain behave differently when flying thousands of metres high in a plane?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The cabin has lower air pressure and oxygen levels than the outside world, which can make the brain feel greater extremes such as euphoria and depression.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4.Which word means ‘wishing for something so much it hurts’?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      ‘Aching’. If you are ‘aching’ for loved ones, you really want to see them.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. True or false:
     <em>
      Virgin Atlantic were genuinely worried for the emotional wellbeing of their passengers.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. Their ‘emotional health warning’ campaign was tongue-in-cheek. In other words, it was just for fun.
