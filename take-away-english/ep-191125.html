     自恋者对自身重要性的错觉和缺乏 “羞耻感” 的特征可能会让你恼火，但心理学家在经过研究后说自恋者可能比大多数人更快乐。本期 “随身英语” 围绕表明这种性格特征好处的研究展开讨论。

     <strong>
      It takes all sorts to make a world
     </strong>
     – so some say. Nobody is the same, and our different personalities and
     <strong>
      character traits
     </strong>
     make us what we are. Wouldn’t it be boring if we were all the same? But if someone doesn’t behave or think like you, it can be frustrating. And there’s one personality type that can be very difficult to deal with -
     <strong>
      narcissism
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Narcissists
     </strong>
     consider themselves the most important person. They’re only interested in their own life,
     <strong>
      without a care in the world
     </strong>
     about the people around them. Their lack of
     <strong>
      empathy
     </strong>
     makes them come across as
     <strong>
      arrogant
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      self-important
     </strong>
     . If you know someone like this, their narcissistic attitudes might irritate you. But you might find it even more irritating to know that, according to new research, they are likely to be happier than other people.
    </p>
    <p>
     An ongoing study of narcissism by researchers at Queen's University Belfast has found such people might
     <strong>
      infuriate
     </strong>
     others but are less likely to be
     <strong>
      stressed
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      depressed
     </strong>
     . Writing about the research, the BBC’s Sean Coughlan says “They might have trampled over others and left a trail of
     <strong>
      emotional damage
     </strong>
     around them - but narcissists also seem to be insulated against feeling bad about themselves.” And their
     <strong>
      heightened
     </strong>
     sense of self-importance appears to give them "protective" qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Researchers have been trying to understand why narcissism appears to be more prevalent in areas such as politics, social media and celebrity culture and why narcissists'
     <strong>
      shameless
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      over-confident
     </strong>
     attitude seems to be rewarded rather than penalised. It does seem that they have the best of all worlds, which is not great news for
     <strong>
      shrinking violets
     </strong>
     . And there’s more bad news for those who are shy and
     <strong>
      retiring
     </strong>
     : previous research by Queen’s University has also found that a ‘mental toughness’ helps narcissists succeed at work and in their social lives because they can overcome rejection and disappointment. And other tests have found that narcissistic students do better in exams, not because they are more clever, but because of their confidence and assertiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
     But psychologist Dr Kostas Papageorgiou from the research team argues that these personality traits should not be seen as "either good or bad" but as "products of
     <strong>
      evolution
     </strong>
     " and "expressions of human nature". So, at the end of the day, we are what we are, and that’s just something we can’t change.
