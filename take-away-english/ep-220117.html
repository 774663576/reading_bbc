     One thing we always remember from our
     <strong>
      childhood
     </strong>
     is our favourite
     <strong>
      teddy bear
     </strong>
     . This soft,
     <strong>
      ragged
     </strong>
     toy was our
     <strong>
      comfort
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      companion
     </strong>
     . As we grow up, we normally give up our
     <strong>
      childish
     </strong>
     ways, and our
     <strong>
      furry
     </strong>
     friend often ends up in storage or at a jumble sale. But that’s not the case for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems that some
     <strong>
      grown-ups
     </strong>
     continue to need their
     <strong>
      cuddly toy
     </strong>
     by their sides. One sleep survey suggested a tenth of people in the UK need a teddy bear in bed. And for some adults, soft toys remain an essential presence ­– they take them wherever they go.
    </p>
    <p>
     A cuddly toy can come in many forms – animals, strange shapes or just a piece of
     <strong>
      stuffed
     </strong>
     material. But it’s the teddy bear in particular that seems to have an
     <strong>
      enduring appeal
     </strong>
     – it gives us a
     <strong>
      nostalgic
     </strong>
     feeling and a reminder of our younger days. Writing for the BBC, historian David Cannadine says, “Perhaps it’s that bears represent the happy
     <strong>
      security
     </strong>
     of a childhood friend who never changes or lets you down.” For whatever reason, teddies appeal to both children and adults of all ages.
    </p>
    <p>
     The teddy bear is much
     <strong>
      celebrated
     </strong>
     these days, and they’ve become something that we don’t just grow up with – people buy them as adults too. There are shops which sell only teddy bears, there are teddy bear museums in many countries, and teddy bear festivals regularly take place around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     While our
     <strong>
      soft toys
     </strong>
     offer us a kind of
     <strong>
      comfort blanket
     </strong>
     , some experts say it’s nothing to be ashamed of. It’s sometimes good to let go of the constraints of adult life and be a
     <strong>
      big kid
     </strong>
     again. And research commissioned by Barclaycard in the UK found 44% of adults have purchased
     <strong>
      playthings
     </strong>
     they enjoyed as children because they bring back happy memories.
     <strong>
      Colouring books
     </strong>
     , cuddly toys and
     <strong>
      board games
     </strong>
     were top of the list. So, if you’re still keeping your teddy a secret, don’t worry – you’re not alone!
