     Life isn’t fair. Some people just seem
     <strong>
      blessed
     </strong>
     with the ability to
     <strong>
      effortlessly
     </strong>
     charm anyone they meet. You know the kind of person, the one who can
     <strong>
      strike up a conversation
     </strong>
     with a
     <strong>
      complete stranger
     </strong>
     and end up with a new friend or business
     <strong>
      lead
     </strong>
     . How do they do it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, it might seem like a magical power, but in fact there are a number of factors at work. So, can you learn to develop
     <strong>
      superhuman
     </strong>
     charm? The answer is:
     <strong>
      to a large extent
     </strong>
     , yes you can.
    </p>
    <p>
     But first, the bad news. Scientists have found that people initially judge each other based purely on physical appearance. With just a fleeting glimpse of a face, people make
     <strong>
      snap judgements
     </strong>
     about each other’s
     <strong>
      likeability
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      trustworthiness
     </strong>
     and confidence, according to Alexander Todorov, professor of psychology at Princeton University.
    </p>
    <p>
     How to
     <strong>
      counteract
     </strong>
     this? There’s one incredibly simple tool: your smile. Todorov told the BBC that people perceive a smiling face as “more trustworthy, warmer and
     <strong>
      sociable
     </strong>
     ”. It sounds like common sense, doesn’t it? Smile and others will smile with you.
    </p>
    <p>
     What other tricks might we have
     <strong>
      up our sleeves
     </strong>
     ? Former FBI agent Jack Schafer has been trained in how to influence people. He told BBC Capital: “Our brains are always surveying the environment for friend or
     <strong>
      foe
     </strong>
     signals.” Three things we can do to signal that we are not a threat are to: raise our eyebrows quickly,
     <strong>
      tilt
     </strong>
     our heads slightly, and, once again, to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     So we’ve looked at body language, but of course
     <em>
      what
     </em>
     you say is hugely important too, unless you want to just stand there
     <strong>
      grinning
     </strong>
     foolishly. Here Schafer recommends that “the
     <strong>
      golden rule
     </strong>
     of friendship is if you make people feel good about themselves, they’re going to like you.” In other words, you need to show interest in them, instead of talking about yourself and all your wonderful achievements. And while you’re chatting, remember this: another way of showing interest is to
     <strong>
      mirror
     </strong>
     their physical position.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another way to form a connection? Find
     <strong>
      common ground
     </strong>
     . Suzanne de Janasz, a professor of management with Seattle University, says that charming people are particularly adept at seeking out shared interests or experiences to help them build
     <strong>
      rapport
     </strong>
     . Simple things like asking where someone’s from really can open up a discussion and allow you to find areas in common. And if all else fails, you can
     <strong>
      fall back on
     </strong>
     that most British of topics: the weather. Glorious day, isn’t it?

    <p>
     <strong>
      1. 阅读课文并回答问题。
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     1. Why is talking about yourself a bad idea?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Jack Schafer believes the best way to make friends is to show interest in other people and make them feel good about themselves, rather than talk about yourself.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Which four things can we do with our bodies to help us connect with others?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Smiling, tilting our heads, raising our eyebrows quickly and mirroring the person we’re speaking to can help us build rapport, according to the report.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Does the author seem surprised that smiling is a good idea?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The author indicates that smiling seems like “common sense”, in other words something everyone knows naturally, and is therefore not surprised.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Which word means ‘stupidly’?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Foolishly.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. True or false:
     <em>
      Our appearance influences what others think of us.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      True. According to Professor Todorov, we make quick judgements about each other based on appearance. But our body language and conversational skills can counteract this.
