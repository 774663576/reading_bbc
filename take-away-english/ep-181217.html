     在当今时代，时尚业竞争激烈，零售商们用各种方式让退货变得不再困难。大多数情况下，消费者们只需要把服饰带回服装店就可以了。这虽然让退换货物变得非常方便，却催生出了不少先大量购买商品，再退还回去的买家。这看似无伤大雅，但公司的利润却因此受到影响。面临这一趋势，很多公司却没有想出相应的对策。本集《随身英语》讨论 “连续退货族” 给卖家带来的影响，并介绍一些和购物有关的英语词汇。

     We've all done it. We buy something we think we like and then change our minds about it. Whether
     <strong>
      panic buying
     </strong>
     , an
     <strong>
      impulse purchase
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      shopper's remorse
     </strong>
     , we're fortunate many companies allow us to easily
     <strong>
      exchange
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      refund
     </strong>
     items. In fact it's so easy these days that
     <strong>
      retailers
     </strong>
     are seeing an increase in a new type of shopper: the
     <strong>
      serial returner
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A serial returner is someone who buys items, often
     <strong>
      in bulk
     </strong>
     , only to return most of them. 41-year-old Hester Grainger, founder of Mumala Club, estimates spending £300 to £400 each month on clothes, but returning "around 80%", she told the BBC. This isn't unique. Barclaycard, which processes nearly half of the UK's credit and debit card
     <strong>
      transactions
     </strong>
     , says that in the last two years 26% of retailers have seen an increase in in-store and online returns – with the number of items being sent back up by 22%.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's a problem for companies. Handling these returns eats into profits. Free delivery for the customer means the company
     <strong>
      foots the bill
     </strong>
     . Items may need to be
     <strong>
      repackaged
     </strong>
     . They are damaged - making them unfit for resale. Tony Mannix, CEO of Clipper, a
     <strong>
      logistics firm
     </strong>
     that handles returned goods for major retailers, said about 5% of them end up "being binned." Sometimes the
     <strong>
      fast fashion
     </strong>
     cycle has moved on. By the time the item comes back, it becomes a
     <strong>
      cut-price
     </strong>
     item on a
     <strong>
      reduced-to-clear
     </strong>
     <strong>
      rail
     </strong>
     - at further loss to the company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some companies are taking action to deter this behaviour. According to a BBC article, four in ten retailers now say they
     <strong>
      charge
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      returns
     </strong>
     to discourage the sending of non-faulty items. Online retail giant Amazon was reported to have started barring customers with too many returned items. This is something a study by retail management system Brightpearl found over half of UK fashion retailers would consider. And Barclaycard says a third of retailers have
     <strong>
      hiked
     </strong>
     their prices to cover these returns.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Vicky Brock, director of data innovation at ReBound Returns, a returns management software system, believes this isn't the best strategy. Speaking in a BBC article, she says discouraging returns shows a lack of understanding by the retailer. Using data, companies can reduce returns by helping customers choose better. Some companies such as Uniqlo and Asos already provide a
     <strong>
      suggested
     </strong>
     <strong>
      size
     </strong>
     based on the customer's previous purchases and information on height and weight. Ultimately, she says, returns are now as much a part of the shopping experience as buying things, and shops need to take this into consideration.
