     世界很多国家和地区的人民都有饮茶的习俗。不论是大口地喝，还是小口地抿，喜爱喝茶的人处处可见。有些人喜欢用茶叶，有些人喜欢用茶包。茶包虽然方便，但茶包中所含的塑料微颗粒物质加重了全球塑料问题。本文讨论如何才能使我们最喜欢的饮品不污染环境。

     Are you a
     <strong>
      tea drinker
     </strong>
     ? If so, you’re not alone. Every day around the world millions of cups of this popular
     <strong>
      brew
     </strong>
     are drunk, and it’s been that way for thousands of years. The oldest discovered tea is from the Han Dynasty, dating from 206BC to 220AD. But it’s thought that the tea trend really took off during the Tang Dynasty in the 8th Century, when it became China’s national
     <strong>
      drink
     </strong>
     . Now, Turkey, the Republic of Ireland and the UK are believed to be the biggest tea-drinking nations, per capita.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tea is
     <strong>
      consumed
     </strong>
     in many ways –
     <strong>
      slurped
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      sipped
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      glugged
     </strong>
     . It can be
     <strong>
      poured
     </strong>
     from
     <strong>
      pots
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      infused
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      brewed
     </strong>
     in the cup using
     <strong>
      tea bags
     </strong>
     – and it’s this latter process that is causing concern. Research last year found some
     <strong>
      premium
     </strong>
     tea bags might be leaving billions of microscopic plastic particles in the cup.  Scientists from McGill University in Montreal found that some ‘plastic’ tea bags shed high levels of
     <strong>
      microplastics
     </strong>
     into water. However, The World Health Organization says such particles in
     <strong>
      drinking water
     </strong>
     do not appear to pose a risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Most tea bags are made from paper, with a small amount of plastic used to seal them shut – made from oil. This has led to debate about whether they can be recycled, but many are still
     <strong>
      composted
     </strong>
     . However, gardener Mike Armitage has told the BBC that the plastic contained in the soil could be washed into streams and rivers and ultimately out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unilever, the owners of the tea brand PG Tips, said their tea bags are made with a small amount of plastic – used to seal them – and that they are suitable for composting. And the brand Yorkshire Tea said their bags do contain 25%
     <strong>
      polypropylene
     </strong>
     , but they were “actively developing plant-based and
     <strong>
      biodegradable
     </strong>
     alternatives”.
    </p>
    <p>
     While tea bag manufacturers might be doing their bit to reduce plastic pollution, it could be a good time to switch your favourite
     <strong>
      beverage
     </strong>
     to coffee, or if that
     <strong>
      isn’t your cup of tea
     </strong>
     then try using
     <strong>
      loose-leaf tea
     </strong>
     , which can have a better flavour.
