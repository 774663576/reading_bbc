     Our brain is probably the most important
     <strong>
      organ
     </strong>
     in our body. It's an incredibly complex thing that helps us think, speak, feel and move. It's no wonder we need to look after it and just like the rest of our body, we need to keep it exercised to keep it healthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our brain is made up of 86 billion
     <strong>
      neurons
     </strong>
     – or
     <strong>
      nerve cells
     </strong>
     – but as we get older some of these slowly die off. In extreme cases, nerve cells in different areas of the brain become damaged and eventually die causing a condition called
     <strong>
      dementia
     </strong>
     where a person is unable to perform certain
     <strong>
      mental functions
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It's a good idea to train our brain by learning ways to increase our memory or
     <strong>
      intelligence
     </strong>
     . I like to stretch my brain by doing a
     <strong>
      crossword
     </strong>
     or a Sudoku puzzle. There's also evidence that learning a second language can boost your brainpower. Dr Catherine Loveday, who's a
     <strong>
      neuropsychologist
     </strong>
     , thinks being
     <strong>
      bilingual
     </strong>
     is a protective factor for the brain because it "involves a lot of switchings and that seems to exercise the sort of
     <strong>
      executive
     </strong>
     parts of our brain. Those parts of the brain are kind of stronger and fitter when it comes to
     <strong>
      resisting
     </strong>
     some kind of damage from a
     <strong>
      stroke
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     But if you're not bilingual there are other ways to stretch your brain: If you're right handed, doing tasks like brushing your teeth with your left hand will improve your brain – or something I find very
     <strong>
      challenging
     </strong>
     , memorising a list of words, such as a shopping list.
    </p>
    <p>
     The main aim of trying these skills is to
     <strong>
      stimulate
     </strong>
     the brain. This is something Dr. Loveday describes as building up our
     <strong>
      cognitive reserve
     </strong>
     – that's building up extra
     <strong>
      abilities
     </strong>
     to help protect the brain against declining memory or thinking. She says "even if people take up languages or take up other things later in life it will give them a degree of protection." As I get older, that has
     <strong>
      put my mind at rest
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     The best bit of research I have read is that eating chocolate may
     <strong>
      enhance
     </strong>
     our ability to acquire and
     <strong>
      utilise
     </strong>
     knowledge – that's our
     <strong>
      cognitive performance
     </strong>
     . It may not be healthy for the rest of my body but at least it might make me
     <strong>
      a brain box
     </strong>
