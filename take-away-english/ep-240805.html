     “Precrastination（提前赶工）” 指过早地快速完成一项任务，通常是为了降低对尚未完成某事的焦虑。提前赶工并不是只有好处。比如，在截止日期前提早交论文虽然会让你颇感轻松，但也让你失去了按照老师在最后一刻给的建议进行修改的机会。我们虽然生活在一个快节奏的世界中，但你依然可以选择慢下来，按时完成任务。这么做也许会让你更加高效。本文介绍了提前赶工这种做法的缺点。

     You've heard of
     <strong>
      procrastination
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      putting
     </strong>
     <strong>
      off
     </strong>
     tasks you'd rather avoid doing until you have to, but what about
     <strong>
      precrastination
     </strong>
     ? The name gives a clue. Pre- means before, so it's the opposite – completing tasks before you need to. So, why do we precrastinate, and is it a good thing, or not?
    </p>
    <p>
     Precrastination is closely linked to anxiety and
     <strong>
      neuroticism
     </strong>
     . People want to finish tasks early so they don't have to worry about them any more. Ed Wasserman, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Iowa, said precrastination is "the
     <strong>
      inclination
     </strong>
     to complete tasks quickly just
     <strong>
      for the sake of
     </strong>
     getting things done
     <strong>
      sooner rather than later
     </strong>
     ". This means you're doing something early
     <strong>
      at the expense of
     </strong>
     something else. That could be a physical, financial or mental expense. Imagine you submit an essay a week before the deadline. You feel a huge sense of relief that it's over, but also can't add the last-minute tips your teachers gave you. If your marks are then lower than they could be, will you feel better
     <strong>
      in the long run
     </strong>
     ? Possibly not. Also, if tasks are
     <strong>
      rushed
     </strong>
     , they are more likely to be less carefully planned, so results could be incomplete or
     <strong>
      inaccurate
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But we live in a
     <strong>
      fast-paced
     </strong>
     world, so it's hardly surprising that we want to
     <strong>
      tick off
     </strong>
     tasks as soon as we can. David Rosenbaum, a professor of psychology at the University of California, believes "It should be agreed in our society that it's OK to
     <strong>
      smell the flowers
     </strong>
     . To be
     <strong>
      deliberate
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      mindful
     </strong>
     and to be allowed to slow down. "
    </p>
    <p>
     If you think you are a precrastinator, what can you do to still feel
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     ?
     <strong>
      Prioritise
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      categorise
     </strong>
     tasks. What needs to be done
     <strong>
      straight away
     </strong>
     , and what can be put off? Recognise that some tasks need
     <strong>
      breathing room
     </strong>
     – they can even benefit from it.
