     人类大量食用海产品使海洋鱼类资源面临枯竭危机。由此，人们开始寻找替代品。一些人认为海蜇是一种可持续的食物来源。本文探究为什么海蜇可以成为替代传统鱼类的可持续选择。

     While giant sharks are more common sea monsters in films,
     <strong>
      jellyfish
     </strong>
     also pose a major threat in real life – with some able to kill people with their stings. And the potential danger they cause doesn’t stop there, with reports of them attacking
     <strong>
      salmon
     </strong>
     farms, shutting down power stations and incapacitating warships. There are even some scientists in Australia researching whether box jellyfish could ultimately destroy our oceans – so could
     <strong>
      devouring
     </strong>
     them be a possible solution?
    </p>
    <p>
     The huge number of jellyfish in our oceans means that if we did start eating them, there is already a large supply of these potential
     <strong>
      morsels
     </strong>
     to be
     <strong>
      dined on
     </strong>
     . Also, some people argue that due to their reproductive cycle, jellyfish are actually a
     <strong>
      sustainable food source.
     </strong>
     Removing a jellyfish from the ocean doesn’t stop new ones being born. This is because they are spawned from polyps on the seabed. In some ways, you can compare them to apples. When you take an apple from a tree, the tree still goes on to produce more apples.
    </p>
    <p>
     What about their
     <strong>
      nutritional value
     </strong>
     ? Jellyfish contain 36
     <strong>
      calories
     </strong>
     per ounce, which puts it on a par with
     <strong>
      iceberg lettuce
     </strong>
     . However, unlike lettuce, it is full of
     <strong>
      protein
     </strong>
     , making it potentially a great
     <strong>
      diet food
     </strong>
     . And indeed, in many parts of the world, particularly in Asia, they are already
     <strong>
      consumed
     </strong>
     , often
     <strong>
      raw
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      fried
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      chopped up
     </strong>
     as part of a
     <strong>
      salad
     </strong>
     . The demand for these animals, combined with their numbers, means that selling jellyfish is becoming an ever more lucrative business.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what do they taste like? While some say they are
     <strong>
      flavourless
     </strong>
     , others describe them as having a
     <strong>
      salty
     </strong>
     taste. This could be due to their absorbent nature, which also leads them to being often served in a
     <strong>
      sauce
     </strong>
     . As for the
     <strong>
      texture
     </strong>
     , some people negatively compare the experience to eating
     <strong>
      gristle
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the next time you fancy
     <strong>
      chowing down
     </strong>
     on some fish, you might look at jellyfish as a sustainable alternative. They might not be the tastiest thing you’ve ever eaten, but it beats fleeing the sea to avoid being stung.

     1. Along with potentially killing humans, what other threats do jellyfish pose?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      They have caused death with their stings, attacked salmon farms, shut down
     </strong>
     <strong>
      power stations and incapacitated warships
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Why are jellyfish potentially sustainable?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because removing a jellyfish from the ocean doesn’t stop new ones being born,
     </strong>
     <strong>
      as they are spawned from polyps on the seabed.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. Why are jellyfish a possible healthy food?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      They are a possible diet food because they have lots of protein and only 36
     </strong>
     <strong>
      calories per ounce.

     4. True or false?
     <em>

     <strong>
      False. At the moment, it seems that only in Asia have some countries fully
     </strong>
     <strong>
      embraced this food source.

     5. What are the negative things related to the experience of eating jellyfish mentioned in the article?
