    <p>
     Happy New Year! For many in the UK, if the New Year means anything, it means starting with
     <strong>
      a clean slate
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      turning over a new leaf
     </strong>
     . And to do this, many of us make New Year's
     <strong>
      resolutions
     </strong>
     – a list of ways that we intend to
     <strong>
      improve
     </strong>
     ourselves in the year ahead. We
     <strong>
      reflect
     </strong>
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     our past
     <strong>
      transgressions
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      resolve
     </strong>
     not to do them again.
     <strong>
      Refraining
     </strong>
     <strong>
      from
     </strong>
     smoking is ever popular, as is a
     <strong>
      vow
     </strong>
     to take up more exercise or spend more time with family. But where does the idea of a New Year's resolution come from?
    </p>
    <p>
     The answer might lie 4,000 years ago in ancient Babylonia, according to History.com. The Babylonians are believed to be the first to hold recorded
     <strong>
      celebrations
     </strong>
     for the New Year. The 12-day-long celebration, Akitu, allowed them not only to
     <strong>
      reaffirm
     </strong>
     their loyalty to the king, or crown a new one, but also to
     <strong>
      pledge
     </strong>
     to the gods to pay their debts and return borrowed objects. For their 'good behaviour', they believed the gods would bestow favour upon them for the year to come. If not, there would be divine consequences!
    </p>
    <p>
     The Romans too had similar traditions. New Year's Day was a time when senators would
     <strong>
      swear
     </strong>
     they had upheld the laws and city leaders and soldiers would
     <strong>
      take an oath
     </strong>
     of loyalty to the emperor. Incidentally, the month of January, is named after the Roman god Janus. He is the god of beginnings, transitions and time, among other things and is depicted as having two faces – one looking to the past and the other facing forward to the future.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Romans may be long gone, but their legacy lives on. Come the turn of the year, our eyes turn inwards. We look at
     <strong>
      self
     </strong>
     -
     <strong>
      improvement
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      review
     </strong>
     our past mistakes, confess our
     <strong>
      wrongdoings
     </strong>
     , seek
     <strong>
      atonement
     </strong>
     and try to sharpen up in general. Ultimately, much like the Babylonians and Romans, we seek to reaffirm the best parts of ourselves, while leaving the dross behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether you're looking at a quick behavioural tweak, or a huge personality overhaul, you're taking part in a tradition that goes back centuries. I wish you all the best sticking to your resolutions. Happy New Year!
