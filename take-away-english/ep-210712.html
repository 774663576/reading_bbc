     你每天平均睡多长时间？八小时通常被认为是 “黄金” 睡眠时间，但这是否因人而异？哪些因素决定一个人究竟该睡多久才好？本期 “随身英语” 围绕这个话题展开讨论。

     Charles Darwin once said “A man who dares to waste one hour of time has not discovered the value of life”. If you live one hundred years, that only
     <strong>
      equates
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     twelve-hundred months – and when you
     <strong>
      break it down
     </strong>
     even further into days, hours and minutes, it gets more frightening. Why is this
     <strong>
      relevant
     </strong>
     ? Well, quite simply put: life is short. Spending eight hours every day in a
     <strong>
      slumber
     </strong>
     means you’re losing a third of your life to bed. So, the question is: is eight hours the exact amount we need, or is it just a
     <strong>
      myth
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     While most scientists agree that between seven and nine hours a night is the
     <strong>
      optimal
     </strong>
     amount, this is just a rough
     <strong>
      estimate
     </strong>
     . In truth, it’s a little more complicated than that. It seems that the amount of sleep you need depends upon your age – with infants needing much more than adults. What does seem
     <strong>
      apparent
     </strong>
     is that around seven and a half hours’ sleep is a good amount. In a study conducted at the University of Surrey Sleep Research Centre, the effects of sleep were
     <strong>
      monitored
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     One group slept for six and a half and the other for seven and a half hours per night. While some
     <strong>
      findings
     </strong>
     were predictable –
     <strong>
      irritation
     </strong>
     and lower
     <strong>
      concentration
     </strong>
     in the group who slept less, there were some more surprising findings. The genes of people who had less sleep were affected. Genes associated with inflammation, the
     <strong>
      immune system
     </strong>
     and stress
     <strong>
      response
     </strong>
     became more active. The team also observed increases in the activity of genes related to diabetes and risk of cancer.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the biggest issues is that myths regarding sleep are constantly
     <strong>
      perpetuated
     </strong>
     . For example, have you ever heard that you can train yourself to need less or no sleep? It’s simply not true. We will always need a certain amount of sleep – eight hours might not be the exact
     <strong>
      sweet spot
     </strong>
     , and there are factors like age to
     <strong>
      take into
     </strong>
     <strong>
      consideration
     </strong>
     , but one thing is true – there is a certain amount we do actually need.
