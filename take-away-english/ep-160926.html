     Do carrots really help you see in the dark? What about kiwis or
     <strong>
      kale
     </strong>
     ? Can eating certain foods improve your eyesight or prevent your eyes
     <strong>
      degenerating
     </strong>
     ? Perhaps we should all be taking
     <strong>
      supplements
     </strong>
     to benefit our vision? Research in both the US and Ireland has shown that supplementing the diet with certain key
     <strong>
      chemicals
     </strong>
     can significantly benefit your
     <strong>
      vision
     </strong>
     . These can be taken as supplements but they are also found widely in many green leafy plants and green and yellow fruit and vegetables.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <strong>
      retina
     </strong>
     is the part of our eye that contains cells sensitive to light. The most delicate area of this
     <strong>
      tissue
     </strong>
     – the
     <strong>
      macula
     </strong>
     – is protected from harmful blue and UV light by yellowish ‘macular
     <strong>
      pigment
     </strong>
     ’. This acts like sunglasses, blocking the damaging light. It comprises three pigments –
     <strong>
      lutein
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      zeaxanthin
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      meso-zeaxanthin
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A research team led by Professor Nolan in Ireland has recently completed a year-long trial investigating the benefits of taking supplements of macular pigments. 100 participants took part in the experiments. The results showed that by taking lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin, there was a significant improvement in the protection of the macula, as well as in overall eyesight. There was also some evidence that these chemicals can help to slow down macular degeneration, which is the main cause of
     <strong>
      sight loss
     </strong>
     in the UK. However, this is somewhat controversial.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lutein is a yellow
     <strong>
      compound
     </strong>
     found only in plants, which produce it to absorb light. We can get lutein by eating foods like kale and spinach. It is also present in egg yolk. Zeaxanthin, another yellow compound similar to lutein, is found in such foods as corn, yellow bell peppers and
     <strong>
      saffron
     </strong>
     . Meso-zeaxanthin is not generally found in food sources, though it can be found in some fish. It is created in the retina from
     <strong>
      ingested
     </strong>
     lutein. It can be taken in supplements made with
     <strong>
      marigold
     </strong>
     <strong>
      extracts
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     As for carrots, it turns out that it’s the leafy green bits on the top that contain the key compounds beneficial to eyesight, rather than the vegetable itself. So next time you’re told carrots help you see in the dark, save them for the rabbit and chop up some kiwi instead!

     1. True or false? Eating yellow and green vegetables can be harmful to your eyesight.
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. Some yellow and green vegetables contain chemicals that are
     </strong>
     <strong>
      beneficial to eyesight.
     </strong>

    <p>
     2. What is the macula?

     </strong>
     <strong>
      compounds beneficial to eyesight, and not the vegetable itself.
