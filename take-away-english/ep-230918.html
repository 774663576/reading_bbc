     Look at many of the items around your home and some will probably have been
     <strong>
      imported
     </strong>
     from abroad by ship. Moving
     <strong>
      goods
     </strong>
     around the world by sea is the easiest and most
     <strong>
      cost-effective
     </strong>
     way to do it. But what has made it more practical is the invention of the shipping
     <strong>
      container
     </strong>
     . They're not the most amazing thing to look at, but because of their design, and especially their
     <strong>
      universal
     </strong>
     size, it means they can be loaded and unloaded on to huge
     <strong>
      vessels
     </strong>
     at any
     <strong>
      port
     </strong>
     that is big enough to accommodate them. The standardisation of these simple metal containers in the 1950s and 60s marked a turning point in
     <strong>
      world trade
     </strong>
     , driving down costs and ultimately leading to
     <strong>
      globalisation
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Inside these
     <strong>
      versatile
     </strong>
     metal boxes could be anything from nappies to cars, and they are transported on container ships that
     <strong>
      ply
     </strong>
     our seas and oceans. They have been described as 'the monsters of the seas' because of their huge size. The very biggest are almost half a kilometre long and are piled high with more than 20,000, 20-foot-long (6.06m) boxes. In fact, the world's largest, The Port of Rotterdam, has a capacity of 24,346 TEU (Twenty Foot Equivalent Unit) – an exact unit of measurement used to determine
     <strong>
      cargo
     </strong>
     capacity for container ships and
     <strong>
      terminals
     </strong>
     . With around 5,500 container ships globally, it's incredible to think about the amount of goods being moved around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, because we now rely so much on these global
     <strong>
      shipments
     </strong>
     of goods, there can be problems when things go wrong. In 2021, the Ever Given, loaded with 18,000 containers, got stuck in the Suez Canal – blocking an important
     <strong>
      trade route
     </strong>
     . Countless businesses were affected by the delay in receiving their goods. One shipping company, Maersk, said the "
     <strong>
      ripple effects
     </strong>
     on global capacity and equipment" were significant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the occasional problems, our demand for goods is increasing, and so the shipping container is here to stay. George Griffiths from S&amp;P Global Platts told the BBC: "We're seeing a lot more of the ultra-large container ships being built… the proportion of new ships that are moving over 14,000 containers is
     <strong>
      staggering
     </strong>
     ." Each container can have a lifespan of up to 25 years. And even when the effects of wind, waves and loading
     <strong>
      takes its toll
     </strong>
     , some find
     <strong>
      a new lease of life
     </strong>
     as land-based
     <strong>
      storage
     </strong>
     units or even used as houses and hotels!
