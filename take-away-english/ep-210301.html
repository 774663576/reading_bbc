     我们认为人类智慧无穷，动物也一样，但植物呢？本文讨论为什么树木能给人类和大自然带来好处，以及树木之间如何互相帮助，相互交流，共同茁壮成长。

     There’s nothing better than a walk in the
     <strong>
      countryside
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      lifting our spirits
     </strong>
     . Connecting with nature has been proven to help our mental health. For some, the best
     <strong>
      tonic
     </strong>
     is to stroll through a
     <strong>
      forest
     </strong>
     , but as we admire the trees that surround us, it’s worth knowing these trees are doing more than just being nice things to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
     We’re already aware of the
     <strong>
      healing properties
     </strong>
     of trees – they produce
     <strong>
      oxygen
     </strong>
     and clean the air we breathe by absorbing about a quarter of all human-caused
     <strong>
      carbon dioxide emissions
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Deforestation
     </strong>
     isn’t helping with this which is why so many people want to save them. But there’s more to these impressive forms of
     <strong>
      vegetation
     </strong>
     than we might think. Researchers have discovered evidence that proves they are actually intelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s thought that trees talk and share
     <strong>
      resources
     </strong>
     right under our feet, using a
     <strong>
      fungal network
     </strong>
     . Under the ground are
     <strong>
      tree roots
     </strong>
     , and mingling among them, along with
     <strong>
      bacteria
     </strong>
     , are thousands of superfine threads of
     <strong>
      fungi
     </strong>
     , known as
     <strong>
      hyphae
     </strong>
     . And research has shown that they are all interconnected. They can help each other by sharing
     <strong>
      nutrients
     </strong>
     , and they can even warn of approaching threats. Scientists say it’s like the trees are talking to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ecologist Suzanne Simard has called this network the
     <strong>
      Wood Wide Web
     </strong>
     . She discovered that parent trees use this network to help their
     <strong>
      offspring
     </strong>
     . Speaking to the BBC, she said: “We found that the parent trees would favour those
     <strong>
      seedlings
     </strong>
     that were of their own
     <strong>
      kin
     </strong>
     versus the strangers” by sending them more nutrients. She also found that trees are smart enough to change their behaviour and have managed to adapt and survive in a changing environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     So it seems trees really are the stars of our natural world, and with around three trillion of them on our planet, it’s time to show them some respect if we want them to
     <strong>
      flourish
     </strong>
     .
