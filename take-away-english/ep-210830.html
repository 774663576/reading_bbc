     Some of us like to keep some things private – maybe we don’t want people knowing about our relationship
     <strong>
      status
     </strong>
     , our age or where we live – because these details are
     <strong>
      personal
     </strong>
     . The problem is, everywhere we go online, we seem to leave a
     <strong>
      digital footprint
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     On our social media accounts, we often display things like our opinions,
     <strong>
      connections
     </strong>
     and holiday
     <strong>
      snaps
     </strong>
     . The issue is, how do we stop everybody seeing everything? Maybe we don’t want a random stranger knowing our favourite type of coffee. And
     <strong>
      cookies
     </strong>
     – there was a time they were just something nice to eat. Now they seem to be
     <strong>
      popping up
     </strong>
     on websites. So how can you stay more private?
    </p>
    <p>
     There are some steps you can take. First, on your social media accounts, check your privacy settings. Many social media
     <strong>
      platforms
     </strong>
     allow everything to be visible by
     <strong>
      default
     </strong>
     , and
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      onus
     </strong>
     is on you to set your
     <strong>
      boundaries
     </strong>
     . And limiting the amount you share isn’t only confined to social media. There are many sites out there that help you to share documents – so a good tip may be to not put anything too private, like passwords, on there. One
     <strong>
      errant
     </strong>
     click may send it to the wrong person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, cookies are designed to improve your
     <strong>
      browsing
     </strong>
     experience by
     <strong>
      tracking
     </strong>
     and saving information about your visits to a site, helping to personalise your
     <strong>
      sessions
     </strong>
     . Deleting your browsing history may help, but there are certain
     <strong>
      apps
     </strong>
     which can
     <strong>
      block
     </strong>
     them if you don’t feel comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, if you want to maintain your privacy online, maybe only share things you’d be happy with a stranger seeing – and if you don’t feel comfortable with cookies, you might decide to invest in some
     <strong>
      tech
     </strong>
     to block them. If that’s not enough, just don’t accept them and visit another site – and why not have a yummy cookie to eat instead?
