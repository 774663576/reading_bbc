     有些人觉得学习另一种语言既有用又有趣。智能手机应用程序的兴起让学习语言变得更容易、更方便。惯来对语言学习热情不高的英国人似乎也充分利用了这种学习方法，开始学习外语。本文讨论为什么在英国有越来越多的人使用手机应用软件学外语。

     Are you learning another language? Maybe you’re trying to
     <strong>
      get to grips with
     </strong>
     it for work or study, or maybe you’re trying to
     <strong>
      master
     </strong>
     it just for the fun of it? Language learning is nothing new, of course, but technology has made it easier than ever to
     <strong>
      grasp
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The popularity of language-learning apps in particular has boomed around the world, especially as more people are working or studying at home. They are usually easy and
     <strong>
      convenient
     </strong>
     to use because you can
     <strong>
      access
     </strong>
     them on your
     <strong>
      smartphone
     </strong>
     . And apps can offer languages not popular enough to be taught at
     <strong>
      evening classes
     </strong>
     or schools or universities.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of us are aiming to be
     <strong>
      bilingual
     </strong>
     to enable us to
     <strong>
      communicate
     </strong>
     with people around the world. But, maybe surprisingly, it’s the British, who are not renowned for their
     <strong>
      enthusiasm
     </strong>
     for language learning, who are leading the way in the growth of these apps. US firm Duolingo told the BBC that in 2020 new user numbers globally were up 67% compared with 2019, while in the UK they
     <strong>
      shot up
     </strong>
     by 132%, almost
     <strong>
      double
     </strong>
     the worldwide average. And London-based Busuu, saw a similar trend for learners based in the UK.
    </p>
    <p>
     But for anyone
     <strong>
      trying their hand
     </strong>
     at a new language, what
     <strong>
      motivates
     </strong>
     them to carry on learning when there isn’t a teacher around to manage their
     <strong>
      progress
     </strong>
     ? Colin Watkins from Duolingo told the BBC that for UK learners at least, “people are learning because of culture,
     <strong>
      brain training
     </strong>
     , family, and relationships, along with school and travel. We want a positive use of our time, and to do something
     <strong>
      productive
     </strong>
     on our phones.” The recent lockdowns have given us more time to do this. Certainly, becoming bilingual or a
     <strong>
      polyglot
     </strong>
     is a good thing, and it helps us to bring the world a little closer together.
