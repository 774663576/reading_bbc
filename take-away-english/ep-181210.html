     我们生活在一个过度拥挤的地球上，人口迅速增长，总数接近80亿人。尽管如此，许多人还是感到孤独或生活处境孤立。英国广播公司展开了一项有关孤独的调查，参与这项调查的5.5万人来自世界各地近240个国家。本集节目分析这项 “孤独调查” 的结果。

      Vocabulary: loneliness 词汇

     <strong>
      : 孤独
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     How lonely are you? Sometimes living alone or being in a remote location with nobody around to talk to can give you the feeling of
     <strong>
      despair
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      isolation
     </strong>
     . It's not a great feeling. There's a common
     <strong>
      stereotype
     </strong>
     that it's something that affects older people more, but research has found that loneliness is something that can affect us all, whatever our age.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a familiar phrase that says it's possible to be
     <strong>
      lonely in a crowd
     </strong>
     – despite being surrounded by hundreds of people, you think you have nobody to talk to or to
     <strong>
      connect
     </strong>
     with and that nobody wants to listen to you anyway. It's probably not true, but loneliness is seen as a big problem for the
     <strong>
      mental health
     </strong>
     of the population wherever they live - so much so that the British government even has a minister for loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
     The BBC recently completed a survey about the topic and it found that people aged between 16 and 24
     <strong>
      experience
     </strong>
     loneliness more often and more
     <strong>
      intensely
     </strong>
     than any other age group. Researchers from the University of Manchester who analysed the data, suggested feeling lonely may
     <strong>
      plague
     </strong>
     the young because it's a time of identity change -
     <strong>
      figuring out
     </strong>
     your place in the world and of learning to
     <strong>
      regulate
     </strong>
     <strong>
      emotions.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Psychology lecturer and BBC presenter Claudia Hammond says that "it's tempting to conclude that something about
     <strong>
      modern life
     </strong>
     is putting young people at a higher risk of loneliness, but when we asked older people in our survey about the loneliest times in their lives, they also said it was when they were young."
    </p>
    <p>
     The issue is certainly being talked about more. And in the UK, the Minister for Loneliness Tracey Crouch has said that "the government now recognises loneliness as one of the biggest
     <strong>
      health challenges
     </strong>
     we face." She also said there needs to be a "national conversation" to end the
     <strong>
      stigma
     </strong>
     about admitting to feeling lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
     The BBC Loneliness Experiment also found the type of culture you live in has
     <strong>
      implications
     </strong>
     for loneliness. People from cultures which tend to put a high value on
     <strong>
      independence
     </strong>
     , such as Northern Europe and the US, revealed they would be less likely to tell a colleague about their loneliness. But in cultures where
     <strong>
      extended family
     </strong>
     is often emphasised, such as in Southern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, older women in particular were at lower risk of feeling lonely.
