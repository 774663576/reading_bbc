     我们为什么做梦这个问题没有明确的答案，但有不同的理论。这些理论包括记忆储存、日常情绪的处理以及帮助我们为日常压力情境进行演练。本文就此展开讨论。

     There are no clear answers to the question of why we dream, but there are different theories. Dreaming is
     <strong>
      extraordinary
     </strong>
     and strange: you
     <strong>
      hallucinate
     </strong>
     , believe impossible things, and people you know may
     <strong>
      merge
     </strong>
     into one another. And then, to top it off, you will likely forget all about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Memory storage
     </strong>
     could be one reason for why we dream. When you are asleep, the brain decides what information you should move to your
     <strong>
      long-term memory
     </strong>
     and what should be
     <strong>
      unlearnt
     </strong>
     . In a TED Talk, psychologist Amy Adkins described a 2010 experiment involving participants studying how to get out of a complex 3D
     <strong>
      maze
     </strong>
     . It was found that they were much better at attempting it if they had had
     <strong>
      a nap
     </strong>
     and dreamt of the maze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another purpose of dreams could be the
     <strong>
      processing
     </strong>
     of our daily emotions, which may add to emotional memory
     <strong>
      consolidation
     </strong>
     . In 2003, the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience published research that experimented with the idea of dreams being a
     <strong>
      replication
     </strong>
     of our daily lives.
     <strong>
      Diary entries
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      dream journals
     </strong>
     of 29 healthy young adults over a two-week period were compared, and it was discovered that
     <strong>
      emotional themes
     </strong>
     from the day were replicated in dreams 35-55% of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Antti Revonsuo, a Finnish scientist, has suggested that dreaming helps us to prepare for and deal with stressful situations. He studied children’s
     <strong>
      nightmares
     </strong>
     , giving an example of being continuously
     <strong>
      chased
     </strong>
     by wolves. He believes dreams like this
     <strong>
      stem from
     </strong>
     our
     <strong>
      ancestors
     </strong>
     and could be a
     <strong>
      rehearsal
     </strong>
     for daily
     <strong>
      struggle
     </strong>
     and survival. In modern times, dreams and nightmares may be preparing us for social situations such as having a fight with a friend, going on a date or having a job interview.
    </p>
    <p>
     With such a variety of theories on why we dream, it seems that more research is needed before we can completely understand their purpose.
