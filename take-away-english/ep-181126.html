      Vocabulary: winter and heating 词汇: 冬日和供暖

    <p>
     In my memory, winters always used to be really unpleasant. You had to
     <strong>
      bundle up
     </strong>
     just to keep warm when you went outside. You were often cold, wet and never more than a
     <strong>
      sodden
     </strong>
     misstep away from a patch of
     <strong>
      black ice
     </strong>
     . If you didn't have a nasty
     <strong>
      slide
     </strong>
     , you'd arrive home to an ice-cold house. And that would mean turning on the heating and waiting. It's a miracle you didn't get
     <strong>
      chilled to the bone
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, things don't have to be so challenging any more. Technology, engineering and design have advanced giving us new solutions to old problems. It means dealing with winter needn't be like
     <strong>
      skating on thin ice
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     With a smart
     <strong>
      thermostat
     </strong>
     , our homes can be
     <strong>
      toasty
     </strong>
     when we need them to be. Many models feature smartphone apps that allow you to
     <strong>
      regulate
     </strong>
     temperature remotely, so we can warm up the house before we arrive home. According to techradar.com, the largest UK-based consumer technology news and reviews website, Tado's model features voice control, while the Nest 'learns' your habits and automatically heats the home for you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clothes have been given an upgrade, too. Electronic
     <strong>
      thermal
     </strong>
     jackets, hoodies and parkas heat up when you turn them on. What better way to keep
     <strong>
      snug
     </strong>
     <strong>
      in the dead of winter
     </strong>
     ? At the touch of a button, or through an app on our phones, the clothing generates heat from
     <strong>
      elements
     </strong>
     placed inside. Many models offer three levels of heating which stay warm for over 12 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, there is the headgear -
     <strong>
      Beanies
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      earmuffs
     </strong>
     that feature speakers included in the fabric using Bluetooth technology so we can listen to our favourite music or, in some cases, have a phone call using the in-built microphone. All while keeping the head warm and avoiding a
     <strong>
      chill
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     For many, the thought of winter used to be enough to
     <strong>
      make their blood run cold
     </strong>
     . But using technology, life needn't
     <strong>
      freeze up
     </strong>
     . With the right solutions, there's no reason why winter can't be really, really
     <strong>
      cool
     </strong>
     .
