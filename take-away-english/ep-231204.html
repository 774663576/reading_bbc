     <strong>
      Astronaut
     </strong>
     Frank Rubiales has returned to Earth after 371 days in space. It was only supposed to be 180, but a
     <strong>
      technical fault
     </strong>
     stopped him from returning as planned. Unlucky for him, but very lucky for scientists who want to see what effects spending an extended time in space has on the human body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Being in space can affect both
     <strong>
      physical
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      mental health
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Weightlessness
     </strong>
     caused by a
     <strong>
      lack of gravity
     </strong>
     can lead to a loss of bone and
     <strong>
      muscle mass
     </strong>
     . Astronauts are recommended 150 minutes of exercise per day to counteract this. Also, space traveller's eyes can be affected by the way that fluids act in zero-gravity. Outside the protection of the Earth's atmosphere, astronauts are
     <strong>
      exposed
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     much higher levels and different forms of
     <strong>
      solar radiation
     </strong>
     . This can potentially cause long-term health problems, such as
     <strong>
      cancer
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It's not just physical health that is affected by being in space. Our mental health can be damaged if we don't get enough sleep. On earth, our bodies respond through
     <strong>
      circadian rhythms
     </strong>
     to the Sun rising and setting to help us sleep, but astronauts on board the
     <strong>
      International Space Station
     </strong>
     see 16 sunsets and sunrises every day. This means that avoiding
     <strong>
      sleep deprivation
     </strong>
     is a challenge.
     <strong>
      Isolation
     </strong>
     , and spending all your time with a small group of people can also affect mental health. Along with isolation, is the pressure that comes from being constantly
     <strong>
      monitored
     </strong>
     by experts back on Earth. With possible future missions to Mars predicted to last three years,
     <strong>
      tensions
     </strong>
     within the crew could become heightened. Astronaut Harry Hartfield reports an example of this where a colleague threatened to open the
     <strong>
      airlock
     </strong>
     and drain the oxygen from the
     <strong>
      spacecraft
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Developing new techniques and technology to support astronauts' health will enable more ambitious future missions. It can also help those of us who are staying on Earth. The Canadian Space Agency is using its expertise to improve health care for people living in remote regions. The technology that supports robots used in space is now being used in surgery in normal hospitals, while
     <strong>
      pressure suits
     </strong>
     are being used to treat
     <strong>
      post-pregnancy complications
     </strong>
     .
