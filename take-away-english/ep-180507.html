     <strong>
      Vocabulary: Food 词汇: 食物

    <p>
     What do you think of when you hear the word ‘festival’? Is it music? Maybe it’s film. Or could it be food? Food festivals are a common occurrence in the UK and take place in all sorts of places and at all sorts of times: from Taste of London, in Regent’s Park each June to Aldeburgh Food Festival in Suffolk in September. Whatever your
     <strong>
      taste
     </strong>
     , there’s a food festival to match – no matter how specialised.
    </p>
    <p>
     Are you a bit of a
     <strong>
      carnivore
     </strong>
     ? Then why not try Meatopia. This three-day, London-based festival takes place at the end of August and is a
     <strong>
      meat lover's
     </strong>
     paradise. In addition to a range of
     <strong>
      ethically sourced
     </strong>
     meat products, from
     <strong>
      juicy
     </strong>
     burgers to
     <strong>
      succulent
     </strong>
     steaks, attendees can listen to live music, watch butchery demos, and attend informal meat-based workshops.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If you prefer a festival that will help you meet your
     <strong>
      five a day
     </strong>
     , then Vegfest is for you. This
     <strong>
      vegan-friendly
     </strong>
     event takes place in a range of UK venues several times a year. Here you can enjoy a wide selection of
     <strong>
      freshly prepared
     </strong>
     vegan food, learn
     <strong>
      culinary
     </strong>
     tips and hear talks on nutrition to help you make the most of your plant-based
     <strong>
      grub.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     If that weren’t niche enough, what about a festival that is dedicated solely to
     <strong>
      marmalade
     </strong>
     ? Held in Cumbria, this
     <strong>
      tangy
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      zesty
     </strong>
     festival of
     <strong>
      preserves
     </strong>
     has been running for 13 years. It includes a competition to find the best homemade marmalade. There are thousands of entries from over 30 different countries across the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you’d prefer something with a little more
     <strong>
      kick
     </strong>
     to it, then you could attend The Ginger and Spice Festival held in Market Drayton. It celebrates its town’s historic connection to Robert Clive, who returned from India with ginger. Because of this, they specialise in baking gingerbread, but also sell a range of
     <strong>
      artisan
     </strong>
     spices from
     <strong>
      mild
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      hot
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     If you have a
     <strong>
      sweet tooth
     </strong>
     , then it could be that the National Honey Show, which started in 1921 and is the largest event of its kind, is the place for you to be. This three-day event attracts over 2000 entrants to their traditional competition, and offers lectures and workshops on beekeeping and, of course, that
     <strong>
      gooey
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      syrupy
     </strong>
     golden nectar, honey.
    </p>
    <p>
     While
     <strong>
      there’s no accounting for taste
     </strong>
     , the UK has something to offer most people. From large-scale festivities, to the smaller more amateur gatherings, one thing is certain: people are passionate about their food. And while some of the products on offer might be
     <strong>
      an
     </strong>
     <strong>
      acquired taste
     </strong>
     , when food is given that much attention, it’s unlikely to
     <strong>
      leave a bad taste in anyone’s mouth
     </strong>
     .
