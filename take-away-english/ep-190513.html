     2018 年，全球热带地区约有 1200 万公顷森林消失，相当于每分钟有 30 个足球场的面积。尽管这与 2016 年、2017 年相比，速度有所下降，但仍是自 2001 年有记录以来，森林面积减少率第四高。《随身英语》讨论大面积砍伐森林对生态环境造成的影响。

     We are all aware of the threats our planet is facing. Experts agree that it’s mainly us humans who are responsible for the
     <strong>
      destruction
     </strong>
     of the environment. Activities such as
     <strong>
      mass farming
     </strong>
     and burning
     <strong>
      fossil fuels
     </strong>
     are
     <strong>
      taking their toll
     </strong>
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     our climate – and we’re suffering too through
     <strong>
      natural disasters
     </strong>
     such as flooding and more frequent
     <strong>
      droughts
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     One of the most
     <strong>
      destructive
     </strong>
     activities we are carrying out is cutting down forests -
     <strong>
      deforestation
     </strong>
     . This is done for many reasons, such as providing wood for fuel, making land available for housing or for creating space for more cattle to graze on. This has been most noticeable in Brazil, which is home to the world’s largest
     <strong>
      rainforest
     </strong>
     . Deforestation there has hit its highest rate in a decade, according to official data. Over the course of a year, an area about five times the size of London has been destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The amount of deforestation in the Amazon and in other
     <strong>
      tropical
     </strong>
     regions has actually seen a decline but the figures are still large. Global Forest Watch say that in 2018, an area equivalent to 30 football fields were cut down every minute. Frances Seymour from the World Resources Institute says that “If you look back over the last 18 years, it is clear that the overall trend is still upwards. We are nowhere near winning this battle."
    </p>
    <p>
     What’s special about places like the Amazon is that they are
     <strong>
      primary forests
     </strong>
     which exist in their
     <strong>
      original condition
     </strong>
     with some
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     of trees dating back thousands of years. This
     <strong>
      habitat
     </strong>
     is
     <strong>
      home to
     </strong>
     unique and rare animals and is critical for
     <strong>
      sustaining
     </strong>
     <strong>
      biodiversity
     </strong>
     . The BBC’s environment correspondent, Matt McGrath, says “These old forests really matter as stores of carbon dioxide, which is why the loss of 3.6 million hectares in 2018 is concerning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Brazil has taken some steps to try and decrease deforestation by introducing government policies including fines for breaking land use regulations and clamping down on illegal
     <strong>
      logging
     </strong>
     . And International campaigns to stop the trade of soy and beef farmed on deforested parts of the Amazon have also had a significant impact. But meanwhile other parts of the world, such as Ghana and the Democratic Republic of Congo, are seeing dramatic increases. So it seems only political will and human
     <strong>
      conscience
     </strong>
     will tackle this problem and save planet Earth.
