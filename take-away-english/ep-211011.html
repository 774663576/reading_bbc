      词汇：resilience 适应力

     We’ve all heard of IQ, and terms like EQ, which relates to your emotional intelligence, are commonly used. But have you heard of AQ? AQ stands for
     <strong>
      adversity
     </strong>
     quotient and measures your ability to deal with the
     <strong>
      ups and downs
     </strong>
     of life. Being able to
     <strong>
      handle
     </strong>
     these
     <strong>
      rough patches
     </strong>
     we all go through is not only important in our personal lives but in our professional lives too. So how can we learn to be more resilient?
    </p>
    <p>
     Adverse situations can
     <strong>
      take us by surprise
     </strong>
     and shock us. In the workplace, it could be in the form of
     <strong>
      redundancies
     </strong>
     , the company we work for going under or being restructured, or even missing out on a promotion. Failed friendships and relationships, financial hard times and even
     <strong>
      bereavements
     </strong>
     are things that can occur outside of work. AQ measures our ability to
     <strong>
      withstand
     </strong>
     the shocks when life throws
     <strong>
      curveballs
     </strong>
     at us – how likely we are to
     <strong>
      crumble
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      thrive
     </strong>
     in these situations. It can be used to predict our attitudes,
     <strong>
      perseverance
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      longevity
     </strong>
     , and the way we learn from changes in environment. In short, our resilience when there is a
     <strong>
      drastic
     </strong>
     change.
    </p>
    <p>
     Luckily, there are some steps you can take to help you be more
     <strong>
      resilient
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      adaptable
     </strong>
     <strong>
      in the face of
     </strong>
     adversity, according to Dr Shahram Heshmat, professor of health economics at the University of Illinois. First, try and find a
     <strong>
      meaningful
     </strong>
     goal. Resilient people often have an aim and are able to concentrate more on a desired outcome, seeing negative situations as
     <strong>
      a bump in the road
     </strong>
     on the way to achieving their goal. Learning to relax and regulate your emotions is another key step – one way to help you destress is by practising breathing exercises. Likewise,
     <strong>
      dwelling
     </strong>
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     things and letting them
     <strong>
      get to
     </strong>
     you can cause you to be stressed. See difficulties more as an opportunity to learn and grow emotionally. Finally, make sure you have a good social
     <strong>
      support network
     </strong>
     . Being able to talk with someone about the challenges we face can help.
    </p>
    <p>
     Things happen in life we can’t prevent – and sometimes they aren’t pleasant. But, taking a few steps to be more resilient can make them a little easier to get through.
