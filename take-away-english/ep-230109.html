     Our environments can affect the way we feel. This is not a new
     <strong>
      concept
     </strong>
     – after all, the traditional practice of feng shui has been with us for thousands of years. More recently, scientific research concluded that the design of
     <strong>
      healthcare environments
     </strong>
     could support patients in their recovery. Increasingly, however, it is our homes that are being seen as places we can improve our
     <strong>
      wellness
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A new
     <strong>
      approach
     </strong>
     to interior design suggests that many of us now care less about how our homes look and more about how they make us feel. How we feel can be influenced by a number of different things, including the
     <strong>
      furniture
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      objects
     </strong>
     within our homes and how these are
     <strong>
      arranged
     </strong>
     . For example, 'to create
     <strong>
      cosiness
     </strong>
     and the ability to
     <strong>
      connect with others
     </strong>
     , we want our furniture
     <strong>
      facing each other
     </strong>
     ', says Lindsay T Graham, a personality and social psychologist. Smaller objects, too, have a lot of power, according to Monica Khemsurov, one of the founders of online design magazine Sight Unseen. Whether it's something an old friend made for us or a
     <strong>
      souvenir
     </strong>
     purchased while travelling, objects allow us to
     <strong>
      relive
     </strong>
     moments or feel closer to people we love
     <strong>
      at a glance
     </strong>
     . It makes sense, therefore, that taking a more
     <strong>
      intentional approach
     </strong>
     to where we
     <strong>
      place
     </strong>
     objects in our home, can affect our
     <strong>
      mood
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Other elements that help create
     <strong>
      a personal space
     </strong>
     that makes you feel good include the type of
     <strong>
      lighting
     </strong>
     , the use of colour and
     <strong>
      texture
     </strong>
     , as well as bringing nature into the home. Plants and 'natural materials, particularly unpainted wood, are really great for
     <strong>
      keeping
     </strong>
     our stress levels
     <strong>
      in check
     </strong>
     ', says environmental psychologist Sally Augustin. And controlling stress levels can also be helped by making sure our work space and any
     <strong>
      clutter
     </strong>
     are
     <strong>
      hidden from sight
     </strong>
     when we want to feel calm, for example, during our night-time routine before going to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     However we choose to adjust our
     <strong>
      living spaces
     </strong>
     to improve wellness, the final tip from the experts is to not treat our homes as a museum. Instead, we should see them as
     <strong>
      idiosyncratic
     </strong>
     and constantly changing – just like us.
