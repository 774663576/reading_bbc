     Do you ever struggle with choosing your
     <strong>
      outfit
     </strong>
     in the morning? If you have a full wardrobe yet still feel you don't have anything to wear, you might want to build yourself a
     <strong>
      capsule
     </strong>
     <strong>
      wardrobe
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what is this? Put simply, a capsule wardrobe is a small selection of items of clothing that
     <strong>
      complement
     </strong>
     each other, and are therefore
     <strong>
      interchangeable
     </strong>
     . Key to the capsule wardrobe is solid
     <strong>
      basics
     </strong>
     , like
     <strong>
      plain
     </strong>
     <strong>
      tops
     </strong>
     , and, ideally,
     <strong>
      neutral
     </strong>
     <strong>
      colours
     </strong>
     , because they make
     <strong>
      combinations
     </strong>
     easier. Think about the
     <strong>
      versatility
     </strong>
     of a simple pair of denim jeans. They can be combined with
     <strong>
      trainers
     </strong>
     and a t-shirt for a
     <strong>
      casual
     </strong>
     look or a
     <strong>
      blazer paired
     </strong>
     with
     <strong>
      heels
     </strong>
     , or
     <strong>
      loafers
     </strong>
     , if you want to look more
     <strong>
      sophisticated
     </strong>
     . Fashion bloggers also talk about
     <strong>
      timeless
     </strong>
     <strong>
      classics
     </strong>
     – picture a luxury black handbag that will
     <strong>
      suit
     </strong>
     any occasion and won't
     <strong>
      go out of style
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But why might it be beneficial to build a capsule wardrobe? Well, by limiting your choices, it can become much easier to choose what to wear, but there is another advantage too – it can reduce the amount of
     <strong>
      fast fashion
     </strong>
     . Fast fashion refers to clothes which are
     <strong>
      trendy
     </strong>
     for just a short time, so are quickly replaced by newer
     <strong>
      trends
     </strong>
     . This results in cheap and poor-quality clothing which has huge environmental costs as waste goes to landfill, resulting in an increase in pollution. According to UK clothes waste charity TRAID, the average
     <strong>
      garment
     </strong>
     is worn just 10 times before being disposed of. So, having a capsule wardrobe with long-lasting and high-quality clothes should help reduce this, even if it means paying more in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fashion and lifestyle magazine, Vogue, says 'building an excellent capsule wardrobe takes time and patience'. But, if you want to reduce waste and have some extra time in the morning, it might be time to start building!
