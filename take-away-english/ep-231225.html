     研究发现糟糕的建筑设计更容易给人带来压力，从而影响人们的心理健康。世界上有些城市已经在城市规划中要求建筑周围要融入自然景观。一位英国设计师认为英国的建筑物过于乏味，希望建筑师们对此作出改变。然而，伦敦 “对讲机大楼” 的建筑经验证明，让建筑物变得有趣并非易事。本文讨论建筑设计对人心理健康的影响。

     More than half the world's population are city
     <strong>
      dwellers
     </strong>
     , and, by 2050, the United Nations predicts that seven in ten people will be. With that in mind,
     <strong>
      architects
     </strong>
     are having to consider how
     <strong>
      architecture
     </strong>
     influences our emotional wellbeing in urban settings.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to Colin Ellard, a research psychologist at Waterloo University, Canada, there is a lot of evidence which shows "the profound impact that the
     <strong>
      design
     </strong>
     of buildings has on how we feel, how we treat one another, and our overall psychological well-being". A study from the University of Heidelberg concluded that people raised in the countryside are less likely to have mental disorders than those raised in the city. The city of Vancouver in Canada, which is surrounded by mountains and ocean, recognises this need to connect with nature. It has included protecting ocean and mountain views in its
     <strong>
      urban planning
     </strong>
     guidelines. For example, tall buildings are
     <strong>
      erected
     </strong>
     in
     <strong>
      strategic
     </strong>
     locations that don't block scenic views for
     <strong>
      downtown
     </strong>
     <strong>
      residents
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The British designer Thomas Heatherwick wants to make architecture less
     <strong>
      soulless
     </strong>
     and boring. He told the Guardian newspaper, "We need to fearlessly demand
     <strong>
      interestingness
     </strong>
     … and make buildings that nourish our senses." He has written a new book, Humanise, where he lists seven characteristics of a boring building. These include being too flat and straight. He says
     <strong>
      lack of depth
     </strong>
     means light and shadow cannot play on
     <strong>
      surfaces
     </strong>
     , while straight
     <strong>
      lines
     </strong>
     are at odds with nature and make buildings
     <strong>
      monotonous
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However, making buildings interesting is not always easy, as architect Rafael Vinoly found out in 2013 when he created the 37-
     <strong>
      storey skyscraper
     </strong>
     known as the Walkie Talkie in London. The building was admired for its
     <strong>
      curved
     </strong>
     <strong>
      exterior
     </strong>
     <strong>
      walls
     </strong>
     covered in reflective glass. However, it acted like a magnifying glass and reflected light which melted nearby cars and almost set fire to a carpet. A
     <strong>
      screen
     </strong>
     had to be added to prevent the building causing further damage.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, for your own wellbeing, surround yourself with buildings that bring you joy, and ideally a view of nature.
