     Did you know many adults
     <strong>
      sit down
     </strong>
     for more than nine hours a day – maybe you're one of them! Whether it's working at a desk, sitting
     <strong>
      motionless
     </strong>
     in a car, bus or train or
     <strong>
      lounging
     </strong>
     on the sofa watching TV, we have a much more
     <strong>
      sedentary lifestyle
     </strong>
     than our parents and grandparents did. The question that this raises is just what is it doing to our bodies?
    </p>
    <p>
     The news isn't good. A study carried out in the 1950s compared bus drivers with the conductors, who walked around the bus selling tickets. It showed that drivers, who spent many hours
     <strong>
      sat at the wheel
     </strong>
     , were twice as likely to have
     <strong>
      heart attacks
     </strong>
     than the more active conductors. In fact,
     <strong>
      prolonged sitting
     </strong>
     has been associated with a number of different conditions, even in people who otherwise take regular exercise. If you sit down all day, you
     <strong>
      burn
     </strong>
     far fewer
     <strong>
      calories
     </strong>
     than someone with a more
     <strong>
      active
     </strong>
     job. There are suggestions that it slows your
     <strong>
      metabolism
     </strong>
     and makes it harder for your body to
     <strong>
      regulate blood sugar
     </strong>
     <strong>
      levels
     </strong>
     , increasing the risk of
     <strong>
      diabetes
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     One possible answer to this problem is for
     <strong>
      desk workers
     </strong>
     to use
     <strong>
      standing desks
     </strong>
     , to spend at least part of their day
     <strong>
      on their feet
     </strong>
     . One small study showed that office workers who stood for three hours after lunch had a much smaller increase in blood sugar levels, while another suggested that by
     <strong>
      standing
     </strong>
     for three or four hours a day over the period of a year, people would burn as many calories as if they had run ten marathons.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other experts question this figure and point out that standing all day can also have negative impacts, such as leg or back pain, recommending that if people do want to use standing desks, they should gradually increase the amount of time that they spend on their feet. Crucially, they also point out that there are many alternatives to sitting, and that their impact is unlikely to be the same:
     <strong>
      walking
     </strong>
     , for example, burns far more calories than standing.
