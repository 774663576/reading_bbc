     Bored with your life? Dreaming of something different? When I feel like that I look up and wonder what life would be like 400km above my head. That's where the
     <strong>
      International Space Station
     </strong>
     <strong>
      orbits
     </strong>
     the Earth, with six
     <strong>
      astronauts
     </strong>
     living and working on board, for months at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
     How do they sleep? They spend the night floating in a
     <strong>
      sleeping bag
     </strong>
     inside a small cubicle on the ceiling. American astronaut Sunita Williams explains: "It's like a little phone booth but it's pretty
     <strong>
      comfy
     </strong>
     and it doesn't matter if I turn over and sleep
     <strong>
      upside down
     </strong>
     . I don't have any sensation in my head that tells me I'm upside down."
    </p>
    <p>
     Brushing your teeth in a place where you can't have a tap or a sink can be a challenge. Can you imagine the mess that running water would make in zero
     <strong>
      gravity
     </strong>
     ? Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield uses a straw to put a big blob of water from a
     <strong>
      sealed
     </strong>
     bag onto an ordinary toothbrush and adds a little toothpaste - which he has to swallow when he's done.
    </p>
    <p>
     Daily exercise is
     <strong>
      essential
     </strong>
     . The lack of gravity makes bones more
     <strong>
      brittle
     </strong>
     and muscles lose strength – so astronauts are encouraged to work out for at least two hours a day.
    </p>
    <p>
     The role of astronauts in the International Space Station is to act as
     <strong>
      lab technicians
     </strong>
     for scientists back on Earth. So they spend their time maintaining their environment and performing and monitoring experiments in a
     <strong>
      confined space
     </strong>
     about the size of a Boeing 747. Almost every task is carefully planned by
     <strong>
      mission control
     </strong>
     - although most astronauts spend their first days losing stuff until they get used to sticking everything they use to the walls with
     <strong>
      Velcro
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      duct tape
     </strong>
     or clips.
    </p>
    <p>
     One of their most valued
     <strong>
      perks
     </strong>
     is the view from "the office", dominated by that gigantic blue ball down there, sitting in the darkness of space. Wow! Absolutely
     <strong>
      breathtaking
     </strong>

     </strong>
    </p>
