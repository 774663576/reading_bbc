     在日常工作和生活中，我们难免会因为需要完成大量的任务而感到大脑 “超负荷”。怎样才能从容地管理工作和生活中的方方面面？不妨列一张待办事项清单。有了它，我们不仅办事更有条理，还能有序地推进所制定的各项计划。同时，每划掉一项任务就能获得一点成就感，可以稍感放松，因为研究表明，人们记住待办事项的能力要强于记住已完成事项的能力。本期 “随身英语” 节目探讨为什么大脑喜欢清单思维。

     <strong>
      Productivity
     </strong>
     can be a struggle for many of us.
     <strong>
      Overflowing
     </strong>
     email inboxes, housework, social obligations – it can be easy to feel
     <strong>
      overwhelmed
     </strong>
     . However, one simple
     <strong>
      tool
     </strong>
     that can help us stay on top of everything is the
     <strong>
      to-do list
     </strong>
     . Write it down, do the
     <strong>
      tasks
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      cross
     </strong>
     them
     <strong>
      off
     </strong>
     – simple!
    </p>
    <p>
     There are three key reasons why lists are beneficial, according to psychologist and author David Cohen. Firstly, they help to
     <strong>
      drown out
     </strong>
     the chaos and anxiety that comes with having
     <strong>
      never-ending
     </strong>
     tasks. By
     <strong>
      writing
     </strong>
     everything
     <strong>
      down
     </strong>
     , we don't have to rely on our memory and can instead focus on the task
     <strong>
      at hand
     </strong>
     . Secondly, lists provide
     <strong>
      structure
     </strong>
     and guidance, giving us a plan to follow. As well as this, our brains are more likely to
     <strong>
      retain
     </strong>
     information that is presented in a
     <strong>
      structured
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      organised
     </strong>
     manner. And finally, lists serve as
     <strong>
      proof
     </strong>
     of what we have achieved, which can help boost our sense of
     <strong>
      accomplishment
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      motivation
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Another possible reason our brains love lists is because of something called the 'Zeigarnik Effect'. This is the name psychologists use for when we remember things we need to do, our
     <strong>
      unfinished
     </strong>
     tasks, better than things we have already completed. Researchers from Wake Forest University tested the
     <strong>
      interference
     </strong>
     of the Zeigarnik effect on a group of people. The experiment began with a warm-up task, though it was stopped half-way through, and only some people were allowed to make plans to finish it. The researchers found that the group permitted to plan had reduced anxiety and performed better in the second task. The problem was, the others still had the warm-up task stuck in their
     <strong>
      active memory
     </strong>
     – an
     <strong>
      unticked
     </strong>
     list of tasks. So, once we
     <strong>
      tick
     </strong>
     something
     <strong>
      off
     </strong>
     our list, our brain forgets about it and we can relax.
    </p>
    <p>
     All in all, it seems lists are a valuable tool for
     <strong>
      staying
     </strong>
     <strong>
      on top of
     </strong>
     life!
