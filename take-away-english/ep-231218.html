     在世界各地，炎热干燥的天气状况正在加剧野火发生的风险。有些国家和地区正在用一种不同寻常的方法来消防减灾 —— “山羊消防队”。他们用放牧山羊群来清除杂草、灌木等易燃的植物。本期 “随身英语” 介绍山羊为什么能比人类和其它动物更好地完成这项任务。

     Meat, milk, cheese – just some of the things provided by goats. But now we can also add
     <strong>
      fire safety
     </strong>
     to this list. As
     <strong>
      wildfires
     </strong>
     damage increasingly large areas of the planet each year,
     <strong>
      goat herds
     </strong>
     may offer a way of reducing the
     <strong>
      risk
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Wildfires are made possible by hot, dry
     <strong>
      weather conditions
     </strong>
     as well as a supply of dead
     <strong>
      vegetation
     </strong>
     that serves as
     <strong>
      fuel
     </strong>
     . We may have limited control over the first factor, but we can control the second. Reducing the
     <strong>
      fuel load
     </strong>
     lowers the probability of wildfires occurring, as well as the amount of damage caused. This is where we can turn to goats to provide a solution. Goats are being used for
     <strong>
      landscape management
     </strong>
     in a number of places around the world, including Greece, Spain, Portugal, Chile and various parts of the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
     Goats have a very tough
     <strong>
      digestive system.
     </strong>
     Many kinds of vegetation that are
     <strong>
      toxic
     </strong>
     to other animals can be easily eaten by goats. It's not just fully-grown plants that goats are able to deal with: any seeds that pass through a goat become
     <strong>
      non-viable
     </strong>
     and will not grow. Human
     <strong>
      clearance
     </strong>
     teams have to worry about getting to hard-to-reach
     <strong>
      vegetation patches
     </strong>
     – goats don't. They are skilled mountain climbers and when standing on their
     <strong>
      hind legs
     </strong>
     , can reach up to two metres to
     <strong>
      devour
     </strong>
     <strong>
      shrubs
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      grass
     </strong>
     that humans would struggle to reach. Because of this, using goats can reduce both the possibility of workplace accidents and the amount of money spent on
     <strong>
      fire protection measures
     </strong>
     . Goat herds have been found to clear some patches of land for a third of the price of human vegetation control teams.
    </p>
    <p>
     Cost and safety aren't the only benefits. Goats are quieter than
     <strong>
      lawnmowers
     </strong>
     and people usually prefer to see goats
     <strong>
      grazing
     </strong>
     rather than litres of
     <strong>
      herbicide
     </strong>
     being
     <strong>
      sprayed
     </strong>
     on the land. Children are often fascinated to see the goats at work and this provides an opportunity to educate people about preventing wildfires.
