    <p>
     At some point in our lives, most of us have attended a school or university lecture. These learning sessions give us some insightful
     <strong>
      nugget of knowledge
     </strong>
     or can be something we yawn through, trying to keep awake. Whatever our experience, lectures have been and still are the most common teaching
     <strong>
      method
     </strong>
     in education. But will they exist in the future?
    </p>
    <p>
     With the growth of the internet and so much information
     <strong>
      at our fingertips
     </strong>
     , you may think there is no need to gather together at a fixed location clutching a handful of
     <strong>
      textbooks
     </strong>
     . BBC journalist Matt Pickles, says "research has shown that students remember as little as 10 per cent of their lectures just days afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Carl Wieman, who campaigns against the traditional lecture, felt talking at students and expecting them to
     <strong>
      absorb
     </strong>
     knowledge was not that
     <strong>
      effective
     </strong>
     so he introduced 'active learning' that encourages problem solving in small groups. He listens to them and guides their discussions. The result has been improved exam results. Other new alternatives to the lecture have included
     <strong>
      peer-to-peer
     </strong>
     learning and
     <strong>
      project-based
     </strong>
     learning that enable students to link up and work
     <strong>
      collaboratively
     </strong>
     on projects such as building a computer game.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes the lecture room is not
     <strong>
      conducive
     </strong>
     to learning; a boring, colourless room is not necessarily an inspiring place for
     <strong>
      stretching the mind
     </strong>
     . At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology two lecture rooms have been refitted to allow students to sit around small tables with screens showing animated
     <strong>
      simulations
     </strong>
     to help them visualise
     <strong>
      concepts
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But new learning methods can come at a high financial cost compared to the relatively cheap way of being taught
     <strong>
      face-to-face
     </strong>
     by an
     <strong>
      academic
     </strong>
     . The real issue according to Professor Dan Butin, founding dean of the school of education and social policy at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, is that "Academics put thousands of hours of work into their books and much less time into thinking about the
     <strong>
      effectiveness
     </strong>
     of their teaching style."  But he says "the lecture has survived because
     <strong>
      research
     </strong>
     , not teaching, determines the success of a university and its academics."
    </p>
    <p>
     So if research quality is a measure of a university's success and money is tight, then the lecture could be here for a little longer. How does that make you feel? How would you improve your lectures?
