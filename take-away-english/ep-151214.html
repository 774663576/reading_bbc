      <strong>
       Chat shows
      </strong>
      are the
      <strong>
       staple
      </strong>
      of late night entertainment TV in many countries. The US has some of the most famous
      <strong>
       hosts
      </strong>
      and the shows are
      <strong>
       syndicated
      </strong>
      worldwide.

      Jon Stewart does comedy; Oprah Winfrey goes for
      <strong>
       heartfelt
      </strong>
      conversation. But what makes a good interview? Is it
      <strong>
       catching
      </strong>
      the guest
      <strong>
       off guard
      </strong>
      ? Will they reveal something more personal - some
      <strong>
       juicy gossip
      </strong>
      that will have us chatting away on social media?
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>

      Larry King is a veteran. For more than 25 years he's been hosting nightly shows in which he interviews movie stars, politicians and ordinary people, who are
      <strong>
       thrown into the spotlight
      </strong>
      . And the secret to getting the best out of an interviewee? King says: "If you ask good questions and
      <strong>
       elicit
      </strong>
      thoughtful answers then you learn more about the person. If the interview's hard – if I begin by saying: 'Why did you do that?' I'd make you
      <strong>
       defensive
      </strong>
      . That may be
      <strong>
       thrilling
      </strong>
      television, but you don't learn a lot."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      King adds that he's learned that the more he
      <strong>
       draws back
      </strong>
      , listens to the answers, and cares about the guest the more he gets from the person. "You make the camera disappear", he says.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Another thing Larry King does is ask
      <strong>
       open questions.
      </strong>
      He explains: "I don't want a 'no'. I don't want a 'yes'. I want a 'why'. So in other words, I want to be a little kind of
      <strong>
       dumb
      </strong>
      , I ask "What do you mean by that?'"
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Being
      <strong>
       amiable
      </strong>
      ,
      <strong>
       courteous
      </strong>
      and curious about the person in front of them – maybe that's what makes a good chat show host. Their biggest talent is making the guest
      <strong>
       feel at ease
      </strong>
      . Another famous American host, David Letterman, seems to know it. He once said: "I cannot sing, dance or act; what else would I be but a talk show host." Good idea: let others do the singing – just make them relax and they'll tell us everything!
