     会议是许多企业和公司的常规组成部分。但很多人认为会议是耗时、枯燥和无效的。有理论证实，人工智能可能是帮助人们组织更好、更高效的会议的答案。人工智能是怎么办到的？本集《随身英语》讨论人工智能是否能给商务会议注入新活力。

     Business meetings are, arguably, a necessary part of any organisation where people work collectively to accomplish a goal. But
     <strong>
      badly managed
     </strong>
     , meetings can be
     <strong>
      unproductive
     </strong>
     , boring and feel like
     <strong>
      a complete waste of time
     </strong>
     . In a recent survey conducted by governance technology firm eShare, it was found that the average UK employee spends over 10 hours weekly preparing for and
     <strong>
      attending
     </strong>
     meetings – approximately 50% of which they consider unnecessary. However, there are theories that technology could improve things.
    </p>
    <p>
     It's "very feasible" for an AI to be able to recognise when one person is
     <strong>
      hijacking
     </strong>
     a meeting, or if a
     <strong>
      circular discussion
     </strong>
     keeps returning to a single issue, says James Campanini, from
     <strong>
      videoconferencing
     </strong>
     company, BlueJeans. "If no new points are made after a while, the AI could suggest to
     <strong>
      wrap up
     </strong>
     ," says Cynthia Rudin, a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But AI isn’t quite there yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     "If AI can do most of the mundane and drudgery work during business meetings, that leaves more space for humans to think about
     <strong>
      strategy
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      vision
     </strong>
     ," believes Niki Iliadis at the Big Innovation centre, London, an innovation hub in AI. This seems to be true. The prefecture of Osaka in Japan started using an AI as a
     <strong>
      minute taker
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      transcribe
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      summarise
     </strong>
     the 450 annual cabinet meetings. It has halved the time needed to produce summaries and cut staff overtime, claims the prefecture.
    </p>
    <p>
     AI can also help with the matter of attendance. If a meeting with irrelevant subject matter is called, or if it's an an inconvenient time, an AI could be used to decide who should attend the meeting and when it should be, says Elise Keith from Lucid Meetings, a US-based meeting management platform.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, one Stockholm start-up, Mentimeter, allows meeting
     <strong>
      attendees
     </strong>
     to give anonymous feedback about a discussion. Using the software, participants can make open-ended responses, submit comments or vote in multiple-choice quizzes. This has "fundamentally changed the dynamics of a
     <strong>
      presentation
     </strong>
     ," says Austin Broad from financial services firm AFH Wealth Management.
    </p>
    <p>
     While tools that can create
     <strong>
      agendas
     </strong>
     , send
     <strong>
      meeting
     </strong>
     <strong>
      invitations
     </strong>
     , distribute
     <strong>
      the minutes
     </strong>
     , and keep track of
     <strong>
      action items
     </strong>
     should improve effectiveness, they are still in development. Let's hope that if or when they do arrive, they will meet our expectations.
