     Are you planning to eat out tonight or are you going to stay in to
     <strong>
      save the pennies
     </strong>
     ? A meal out at a good restaurant or even a pizza parlour can
     <strong>
      set you back
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a small fortune
     </strong>
     , so cooking for yourself
     <strong>
      makes
     </strong>
     <strong>
      financial sense
     </strong>
     . But with the rise in food prices, it's important to be a
     <strong>
      savvy
     </strong>
     shopper to
     <strong>
      keep
     </strong>
     your food bill
     <strong>
      in check
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     These days our supermarket shelves are packed with a tempting array of food items: from the daily staples, like bread and milk, to the exotic, like mangoes and saffron. There's also the option of buying ready meals – convenient food that
     <strong>
      comes at a price
     </strong>
     . However, if you're
     <strong>
      feeling the pinch
     </strong>
     , there are things you can do to
     <strong>
      make the money
     </strong>
     you spend on food
     <strong>
      go further
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the BBC Food website, it's all about changing your habits. It claims that cooking filling and tasty meals
     <strong>
      on a budget
     </strong>
     is easy. It suggests a number of 'tricks' such as using cheaper cuts of meat, "
     <strong>
      bulk out
     </strong>
     small amounts of meat with less expensive proteins" and "transform small amounts of leftovers into a filling meal".
    </p>
    <p>
     A favourite pastime of mine to help when money is
     <strong>
      tight
     </strong>
     is to
     <strong>
      stock up
     </strong>
     on items that are on special offer – such as
     <strong>
      BOGOF
     </strong>
     deals (Buy one, get one free). However, this is more of a problem when it comes to perishable items like fresh fruit and vegetables. In the UK, about 39% of household food waste is fruit and veg. So it's a good idea not to stock up on too much of these things. Store them carefully and make the most of them in all your recipes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Food waste is a big problem generally so shopping carefully can also reduce the amount we throw away. And in Edinburgh in Scotland, it's possible to reduce waste and not
     <strong>
      break the bank
     </strong>
     by visiting a recycled food shop, which has been set up to prevent surplus food from shops ending up in the bin. The Food Sharing Hub allows people to pay as much as they want for the rescued food, which is past its 'best before date'.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, the biggest thing you can do to help your
     <strong>
      cash flow
     </strong>
     is to
     <strong>
      cut back on
     </strong>
     takeaway coffees and lunches. Making your own is usually healthier for you and your
     <strong>
      finances
     </strong>
