     ,' is another. '
     <strong>
      Fine feathers do not make fine birds

     ,' is a third. What do they have in common? They remind us that something's
     <strong>
      appearance
     </strong>
     should not be the most important thing when determining its value. This is what the
     <strong>
      body positivity
     </strong>
     movement is all about. Its message is that we should value ourselves for who we are
     <strong>
      warts and all
     </strong>
     – accept our
     <strong>
      flaws
     </strong>
     and stop judging ourselves against our
     <strong>
      imperfections
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But it's easier said than done. Despite this rise in positivity, many people still feel
     <strong>
      insecure
     </strong>
     about themselves and their appearance because it may not
     <strong>
      measure up
     </strong>
     to the objectified stereotype. So what can a person do to improve their own body positivity?
    </p>
    <p>
     Not comparing your body to others', particularly celebrities', is a good first step. "We're surrounded by these
     <strong>
      idealised
     </strong>
     images of what it is to be beautiful," says Becky Young, founder of the Anti Diet Riot Club – a club helping people rethink their relationship with their bodies and food. She points out that comparing only creates a standard we think we need to
     <strong>
      aspire to
     </strong>
     and leads to feelings of disappointment if we aren't
     <strong>
      up to scratch
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     'Learn to take a
     <strong>
      compliment
     </strong>
     ,' recommends Thriveworks, a counselling and coaching website which promotes positive mental health. When someone says something nice, embrace it – don’t push it away or
     <strong>
      play
     </strong>
     it
     <strong>
      down
     </strong>
     . And compliment others too. If you think someone looks nice, or someone has a good idea, tell them. It can
     <strong>
      lift
     </strong>
     them
     <strong>
      up
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Appreciate
     </strong>
     your body for what it can do – walking, yoga, playing sport or otherwise. "You can be an incredible human regardless of your shape or size," says Esther Field, a body-positive social media campaigner interviewed by the BBC. After knee surgery, "I attended the gym and realised how strong and capable my body was, even though it was fat."
    </p>
    <p>
     And finally, don't forget that low self-esteem and body confidence issues affect everyone. "There aren't a lot of guys that are pushing this idea of body positivity," David Fadd, a
     <strong>
      plus-size
     </strong>
     male model of two years told the BBC. The social media influencer wants to remind us that body image and confidence affect men too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ultimately, the only person who can truly affect your body positivity is you. Becoming comfortable with yourself is unlikely to be accomplished overnight – but don't give up. Remember that everyone is insecure sometimes. And as David Fadd says "be unapologetic about who you are and what you want as a person. Love what you look like."
