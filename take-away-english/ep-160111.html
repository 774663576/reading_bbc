      "Does my
      <strong>
       bum
      </strong>
      look big in this?" That's what I asked myself when I tried on the
      <strong>
       designer
      </strong>
      jeans I bought in the Christmas sales and the mirror… well, the mirror didn't actually
     </span>
     <span>
      say anything but I got the message: It's time to go on a diet!
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Sometimes we just don't know how many
      <strong>
       calories
      </strong>
      we eat. Experts say cooking meals
      <strong>
       from scratch
      </strong>
      can help you think about the
      <strong>
       ingredients
      </strong>
      which go into your food. Tam Fry, from the UK's National
      <strong>
       Obesity
      </strong>
      Forum, says: "Learning how to cook
      <strong>
       fresh
      </strong>
      food is really the number one thing to consider when tackling obesity and improving
      <strong>
       weight loss
      </strong>
      ."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      If you can't cook, Fry recommends that you be more aware of what you put in your trolley when you go to the supermarket. He points out: "People don't read
      <strong>
       food
      </strong>
      <strong>
       labels
      </strong>
      . At government level making the labels easier to read and understand is key, but just looking at how many
      <strong>
       grams
      </strong>
      of sugar is in something is really important."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Some experts believe that a good way to reduce your
      <strong>
       waistline
      </strong>
      might be to start by reducing the size of the plate you eat from. Research has suggested that people eat most of what they serve themselves, so big
      <strong>
       portions
      </strong>
      lead to
      <strong>
       overeating
      </strong>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      A study by Dr Brian Wansink, from Cornell University, US, claimed that reducing plate size from about 30cm to 25cm typically results in 22% fewer calories being served, as the smaller plate makes a normal
      <strong>
       serving
      </strong>
      seem more
      <strong>
       filling
      </strong>
      . However, once plate size went below about 24cm, "people begin to realise they're tricking themselves and go back for seconds and thirds".
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      I think I'll keep my current plates for now. As for me, nothing beats an inspiring image on the fridge door – a picture of my lovely jeans – with some wise quote as a caption. As supermodel Kate Moss once said: "Nothing tastes as good as
      <strong>
       skinny
      </strong>
      feels." No more big bum for me!
