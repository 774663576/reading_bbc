     How much do you spend on
     <strong>
      looking after
     </strong>
     yourself each month? We all like to look and feel good, so it's nice to spend money on ourselves sometimes! You might spend your hard-earned cash on visiting the
     <strong>
      hairdresser
     </strong>
     , a
     <strong>
      gym
     </strong>
     <strong>
      membership
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      pampering
     </strong>
     yourself with a
     <strong>
      massage

     When it comes to hair and beauty, the average UK household spends just under 2% of their budget, according to personal finance experts, Nimble Fins. That's about £38 a month if you have an annual salary of £30,000. Areas that were looked at in their survey included
     <strong>
      toiletries
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      cosmetics
     </strong>
     , and related
     <strong>
      electrical appliances
     </strong>
     , like
     <strong>
      hairdryers
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However, it seems that some people spend much more than that. The booking app for all things
     <strong>
      aesthetic
     </strong>
     , Pamperbook, carried out a survey in 2022 of 900 UK
     <strong>
      salons
     </strong>
     and freelancers. The results found that female
     <strong>
      clients
     </strong>
     who use the app spend, on average, £1,000 per month. The survey showed that the most popular treatments were
     <strong>
      lashes
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      lip
     </strong>
     <strong>
      fillers
     </strong>
     , while customers frequently visited hair salons for a
     <strong>
      blow dry
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But it's not only women who spend money on beauty. Though men and women visit
     <strong>
      spas
     </strong>
     more or less equally, according to the International Spa Association, or ISPA, men spend more on
     <strong>
      treatments
     </strong>
     . A national survey in 2019 found that male participants spend more on massages and
     <strong>
      facials
     </strong>
     per year than women – £501 to £445. Garrett Mersberger, head of the ISPA, said: "Men are more aware that it's not just a thing I go to to get pampered. It's an actual
     <strong>
      lifestyle
     </strong>
     <strong>
      choice
     </strong>
     with benefits to my body, my
     <strong>
      wellness
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether you tend to spend money on these things or not, it can certainly feel good to
     <strong>
      treat
     </strong>
     yourself every now and then!
