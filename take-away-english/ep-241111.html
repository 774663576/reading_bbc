     当我们从零开始学习一门语言时，进步通常比较明显；然而，如果想要在到达中级水平后更进一步，就要付出更多努力，学习中的这种现象被称为 “中级瓶颈期（intermediate plateau）”。本文介绍可以帮助我们突破英语学习中瓶颈期的方法。

     So, you've reached an intermediate level of English – congrats! You can understand most things about familiar topics and can express yourself in most situations. But maybe you've been here a while, and now you're
     <strong>
      stuck
     </strong>
     in what we call the '
     <strong>
      intermediate plateau
     </strong>
     '. Often when we begin learning something, progress is fast and noticeable, but perhaps now it's difficult to see your improvements. Let's see if some new ideas can
     <strong>
      propel
     </strong>
     your learning forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     If your study routine mostly consists of
     <strong>
      flash cards
     </strong>
     and grammar exercises, it's time to
     <strong>
      switch it up
     </strong>
     . In an article called 'The four strands' by Paul Nation, he suggests that while such exercises are important for building a
     <strong>
      strong foundation
     </strong>
     , we should also make time for more meaning-focused learning. That means lots of reading and listening, with a focus on gaining knowledge and enjoyment from the topic itself and learning new vocabulary through
     <strong>
      context clues
     </strong>
     . That way, you
     <strong>
      immerse yourself in
     </strong>
     the language and
     <strong>
      get a feel for
     </strong>
     how it's used in the real world.
    </p>
    <p>
     But don't stop there! Next, you've got to actually produce the language in a purposeful way. According to Merrill Swain's '
     <strong>
      Output
     </strong>
     Hypothesis', speaking helps us to notice holes in our knowledge that we can then work on. Speaking also gives us the chance to experiment with language and, following feedback, either correct or maintain it. What about
     <strong>
      fluency
     </strong>
     ? Fluency is using what you already know smoothly and quickly, without focusing on learning new words. Set a timer and talk to yourself about a topic, then repeat, setting a shorter timer each time.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Breaking through
     </strong>
     the intermediate plateau is
     <strong>
      tricky
     </strong>
     . But, the key is not to rely on just one type of activity. Experiment with a well-balanced approach, varied materials, and above all, enjoy yourself, and you'll start seeing
     <strong>
      incremental
     </strong>
     improvements that'll send you on your way to
     <strong>
      master
     </strong>
     English at a higher level.

    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      False. According to Paul Nation's article, while flashcard and grammar exercises are important for building a strong foundation, we should also make time for more meaning-focused learning.

     <strong>
      According to the 'Output Hypothesis', speaking helps us to notice holes in our knowledge. It also gives us the chance to experiment with language and then either correct or maintain it, depending on feedback.

    <p>
     5. What activity is suggested to practise fluency?
    </p>
