     忘记一件事往往令人沮丧。比如当你走进一个地方却忘记了为什么要去，或者和一个认识的人打招呼却不记得对方的名字。但实际上，遗忘某些记忆的能力对生物的生存十分重要。本文讨论为什么遗忘也是一种必要的能力。

     Have you ever bumped into someone and their name just doesn't
     <strong>
      come to you
     </strong>
     ? Or, you walk into a room and suddenly can't
     <strong>
      recall
     </strong>
     why you're there? Being
     <strong>
      forgetful
     </strong>
     can be really annoying, sometimes even embarrassing. But what if I told you that there are actually good reasons for our memories
     <strong>
      fading away
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     In a BBC interview,
     <strong>
      neuroscientist
     </strong>
     Charan Ranganath uses a
     <strong>
      hoarding
     </strong>
     analogy. We don't tend to
     <strong>
      store
     </strong>
     everything we've ever owned in our house. Similarly, we don't need to store all our memories either. He says, "If we didn't forget anything, we'd be hoarding memories, and you'd never be able to find what you want, when you want it." For example, you don't need to remember the hotel number weeks after you've left the hotel or
     <strong>
      memorise
     </strong>
     all the faces you pass on the street.
    </p>
    <p>
     We also need to be able to forget things in order to
     <strong>
      update
     </strong>
     our memories with new information. Imagine you get used to the same school timetable or work schedule for a whole year, but the next year, you have new procedures or routines. Your brain needs to be
     <strong>
      flexible
     </strong>
     and forget irrelevant details in order to handle the new information. Or, maybe it's been 10 years since you last saw a distant relative. It's likely their face has changed a lot since then, so that memory needs to be updated as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     And, if you've ever been convinced that you know a word, but it just doesn't
     <strong>
      pop into
     </strong>
     your head, you're not alone. This
     <strong>
      tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon
     </strong>
     may suggest that some things are not fully forgotten, just currently inaccessible. Those with a higher level of knowledge are more affected by this, according to studies such as 'Impact of knowledge and age on tip-of-the-tongue rates', because their brains have to
     <strong>
      sort through
     </strong>
     more information to find the word.
    </p>
    <p>
     Memories are sometimes compared to a cliff: once they have crumbled, they are lost and cannot be
     <strong>
      retrieved
     </strong>
     . However, in their article 'Forgetfulness: Why your mind
     <strong>
      going blank
     </strong>
     can be a benefit', Sanjay Sarma and Luke Yoquinto write that forgetting, it seems, is "less like a cliff slowly collapsing into the sea, and more like a house deep in the woods that becomes harder and harder to find".

    <p>
     1. What is Charan Ranganath's hoarding analogy?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The hoarding analogy says that just as we don't tend to store everything we've
     </strong>
     <strong>
      ever owned in our house, we don't need to store all our memories either.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. What are two examples given for why we need to update our memories?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Examples for when you have to update your memory include when you are given a new timetable or routine, and when you see a relative you haven't seen for years.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. What is the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon is where you are convinced you know a word, but it doesn't pop into your head.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. True or False?
     <em>
      People with higher levels of knowledge are more likely to experience the tip-of-the-tongue-phenomenon.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      True. Those with a higher level of knowledge are more affected by this, because their brains have to sort through more information to find the word.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Do Sanjay Sarma and Luke Yoquinto agree that memory is like a cliff collapsing?
