     你听说过 “nutrient density（营养素密度）” 这个概念吗？它的意思是 “食物中每单位热量能够提供的其他营养物含量”。借助这个概念，科学家能够辨别出生活中哪些食物对我们的健康更有益处。比如，多吃新鲜水果和蔬菜，少吃高热量的食物，并丰富饮食的种类。本期节目介绍在日常饮食中改善营养的好方法。

     A can of soft drink and two large eggs may have a similar number of
     <strong>
      calories
     </strong>
     , but the eggs will provide us with
     <strong>
      protein
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      vitamins
     </strong>
     and other
     <strong>
      nutrients
     </strong>
     , and satisfy our hunger, while a fizzy drink provides little more than tooth decay and calories. The important concept here is
     <strong>
      nutrient density
     </strong>
     . This is the number of nutrients we take in for each calorie
     <strong>
      consumed
     </strong>
     . No one would suggest replacing sweet drinks with eggs, but what can we do to increase nutrient density in our
     <strong>
      diet
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     "Have you had your five a day?" that's the message on British supermarket shelves, and it's asking about
     <strong>
      fruit
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      vegetables
     </strong>
     . Many countries have launched similar campaigns to encourage people to eat more healthily.
     <strong>
      Fresh
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      natural
     </strong>
     <strong>
      produce
     </strong>
     is usually very
     <strong>
      dense
     </strong>
     <strong>
      in
     </strong>
     nutrients. Eating a wide range of fruits and vegetables is important, so some advice focuses on including different colours of food in our diets. 'Eating a rainbow' could be one way to get more nutrients.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other advice recommends that we are more adventurous in what we eat. Cooking food that we haven't eaten before can lead us to use
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     that we don't usually consume. This can give us a wider range of nutrients. It's not just about fruit and vegetables. Even using different
     <strong>
      seasoning
     </strong>
     can offer health benefits. Nutrition academic Hazel Flight highlights that flavourings such as garlic, ginger or turmeric can have
     <strong>
      antioxidant
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      anti-inflammatory
     </strong>
     properties, while also leading people to use less salt.
     <strong>
      Dairy
     </strong>
     products such as milk and cheese, are high in
     <strong>
      calcium
     </strong>
     , while in limited amounts, meat can be a good source of protein.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you're not feeling that adventurous, then swapping individual food items can be
     <strong>
      beneficial
     </strong>
     . Choosing
     <strong>
      wholegrain
     </strong>
     bread or rice instead of
     <strong>
      white
     </strong>
     bread or rice can increase
     <strong>
      fibre
     </strong>
     intake.
     <strong>
      Unsalted
     </strong>
     nuts provide more nutrients than snacks such as crisps. Possibly surprisingly, popcorn is a wholegrain snack that is high in fibre.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, fresh fruit and vegetables, swapping the worst things, and just a little bit more adventure could be the secret to a more nutritious diet.
