     Have you ever attended a job interview? For some people they can be a painful and embarrassing experience, but for others, it can be a chance to shine – a platform to perform and show off their
     <strong>
      talents
     </strong>
     . But sometimes, even for the most confident
     <strong>
      candidates
     </strong>
     , things don't go to plan and the
     <strong>
      interviewee
     </strong>
     is left feeling they'd wish they had never stepped foot in the room!
    </p>
    <p>
     The interview is a necessary part of the
     <strong>
      recruitment process
     </strong>
     , and if carried out fairly, can be a good way to select the ideal person to fill a
     <strong>
      position
     </strong>
     in a company. This can be done by just asking questions or by carrying out other tasks that test someone's
     <strong>
      competencies
     </strong>
     . It's also a chance for the interviewee to ask questions and get a feel for their potential new
     <strong>
      employer
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     All this is to be expected when applying for a new job. But the BBC has found there are many examples of situations where inappropriate questions have been asked and irrelevant things have been discussed. Olivia Bland recently attended an interview at a technology company in the UK and claimed to have been subjected to a "brutal" two-hour job interview. She said the company's
     <strong>
      CEO
     </strong>
     "tried his best to intimidate" her and that in her feedback… "He told me everything I did was wrong, everything I said, the way I sat, my body language, everything that he could do to attack me." She actually got a
     <strong>
      job offer
     </strong>
     but turned it down. The CEO did apologise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Other people have told the BBC about the
     <strong>
      grilling
     </strong>
     they received about their personal lives. For example, mature student Kevin Helton said "The interviewer asked, 'You used to be in the Army, how many people have you killed?'" Jo Foat was asked by an interviewer to wear a large straw hat and was told "In my experience, pretty girls like you rely too much on their looks."
    </p>
    <p>
     There are, of course, laws against
     <strong>
      discrimination
     </strong>
     , and managers should only be asking questions that are relevant to a
     <strong>
      vacancy
     </strong>
     . But sometimes, according to James Reed, chairman of
     <strong>
      employment agency
     </strong>
     Reed, what may appear to be an inappropriate question is said "…to
     <strong>
      provoke
     </strong>
     you, and there's nothing illegal about provoking someone, but they can be annoying."
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, some
     <strong>
      unconventional
     </strong>
     job interviews can be fun and are designed to put you at ease. A French
     <strong>
      marketing agency
     </strong>
     is inviting
     <strong>
      applicants
     </strong>
     for an
     <strong>
      internship
     </strong>
     to discuss the opportunity over a game of Fortnite! Now that sounds like a fun way to develop your
     <strong>
      career
     </strong>
     !
