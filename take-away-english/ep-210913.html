     Some say you can tell a lot about a person by the way they decorate their home. We often find pleasure in the things we
     <strong>
      stick
     </strong>
     in our houses, be it
     <strong>
      trinkets
     </strong>
     we bought on holiday, film
     <strong>
      memorabilia
     </strong>
     or paintings to
     <strong>
      liven up
     </strong>
     walls. And when we head to others’ houses, we often see things we appreciate, but wouldn’t have in our own homes, because maybe they’re not quite
     <strong>
      to our taste
     </strong>
     . The point is, the way we
     <strong>
      decorate
     </strong>
     our homes is very personal. And while many of us have plenty of stuff, there are always people who go that little bit further. So, when it comes to
     <strong>
      minimalism
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      maximalism
     </strong>
     , which one appeals to you more?
    </p>
    <p>
     Minimalism was an art movement that started in the 1950s. Its basic principles are derived from a concept of ‘
     <strong>
      less is more
     </strong>
     ’ – reducing things back to their most basic. Some people took that art style and used it as a way of living. Ideas of
     <strong>
      vast
     </strong>
     open spaces with an organised and
     <strong>
      functional
     </strong>
     structure may spring to mind. They are usually decorated in simple
     <strong>
      pastel
     </strong>
     colours, with many minimalists opting for
     <strong>
      duotone
     </strong>
     , often just black and white. For some, especially maximalists, it may seem
     <strong>
      sparse
     </strong>
     and a bit
     <strong>
      bland
     </strong>
     to live without many things – even boring or depressing. However, living in this way is seen by many as more practical.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maximalism is the opposite of minimalism and started in the 1970s. It embraces the
     <strong>
      core
     </strong>
     ideals that ‘more is more’. While minimalism centres around the principle of
     <strong>
      decluttering
     </strong>
     , it’s easy to imagine that a maximalist home is
     <strong>
      overflowing
     </strong>
     with items – but that’s not the base idea. It’s more about filling the space – making the most of the area.
     <strong>
      Structured
     </strong>
     <strong>
      excess
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      bold
     </strong>
     colours combined with mixed patterns is what you will see in a home like this. For a minimalist, used to more simplistic designs, it could be overwhelming. But for those who embrace it, those things give a space personality.
    </p>
    <p>
     The way you have your home is up to you! But, if you opt for maximalism, you may need to prepare for a bit more dusting.
