      词汇：cleaning 清洁
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     You may well have heard of the term ‘spring cleaning’: the act of giving your house a
     <strong>
      deep clean
     </strong>
     in the spring months. Even though, for many of us, that ritual of a once-a-year
     <strong>
      blitz
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      dirt
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      grime
     </strong>
     is dying out, some of us still practise it. However, there could be a good reason the tradition isn’t as popular as it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     The spring months are associated with new life and warmth – a stark contrast to the cold, gloomy winter that preceded. For protection against the freezing weather outside, people would seal their doors and windows as best they could to keep the heat in. In a time when many houses had fireplaces, open fires would churn out smoke and
     <strong>
      soot
     </strong>
     , coating rooms with layers of
     <strong>
      muck
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      gunk.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     It therefore made sense for people to start cleaning in the spring, when the weather was warmer and windows opened, to
     <strong>
      freshen up
     </strong>
     their houses,
     <strong>
      swabbing
     </strong>
     the floors and cleaning the walls. However, open fires are no longer commonplace in modern British homes, with people preferring central heating to
     <strong>
      filthy
     </strong>
     smoke. And it’s not just the way of heating our homes that has changed. In the past, cleaning was designated to specific times and days, as simple
     <strong>
      chores
     </strong>
     like washing clothes took a long time. The rise of gadgets such as the
     <strong>
      washing machine
     </strong>
     means that tasks are quicker and more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, psychologists such as Dr Jonathan Fader, argue that the mental health benefits of
     <strong>
      clearing
     </strong>
     the house of
     <strong>
      mess
     </strong>
     means that a spring clean is hugely positive. The perception of your house being
     <strong>
      cluttered
     </strong>
     can cause the stress hormone cortisol to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while the tradition is still there, and it’s nice to have a big
     <strong>
      purge
     </strong>
     of dirt once in a while, it is no longer as necessary – or limited to just the spring. That said, the psychological benefits of having a
     <strong>
      tidy
     </strong>
     home means that a once-a-year purge of unnecessary items, rather than dirt, can make you feel much better.
