    <p>
     If a
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     of bee disappears forever or a particular plant is
     <strong>
      extinct
     </strong>
     , what does it have to do with us humans? Well, according to a team of international scientists,
     <strong>
      biodiversity
     </strong>
     is dropping below levels considered safe for the wellbeing of human societies.
    </p>
    <p>
     The issue is that everything is
     <strong>
      interconnected
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      ecosystems
     </strong>
     support our societies because they provide us with, for example,  food, fibres and fuels.
    </p>
    <p>
     If species go on disappearing, this can
     <strong>
      interfere
     </strong>
     with vital processes such as crop
     <strong>
      pollination
     </strong>
     and the
     <strong>
      decomposition
     </strong>
     of waste.
    </p>
    <p>
     A
     <strong>
      framework
     </strong>
     which defines the environmental limits within which humans can operate – called
     <strong>
      planetary bound
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      ries
     </strong>
     - says that losing more than 10% of the biodiversity in an area places the local ecosystem at risk. Ecosystems are all different but this percentage is considered a good measure of safety.
    </p>
    <p>
     A study published in the magazine Science suggests that 58% of the world's
     <strong>
      land surface
     </strong>
     already falls below this level. These areas house 71% of the global population.
    </p>
    <p>
     Professor Andy Purvis, from Imperial College London and the
     <strong>
      Natural History Museum
     </strong>
     , is one of the authors of the study. He says: "Once we're the wrong side of the boundary it doesn't mean everything goes wrong immediately, but there is a markedly higher risk that things will go badly wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
     The researchers found that
     <strong>
      grasslands
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      savannas
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      shrub lands
     </strong>
     were most affected by biodiversity loss on average.
    </p>
    <p>
     Purvis hopes this report can be a wake-up call to those who design policies. Here's his warning: "
     <strong>
      Decision-makers
     </strong>
     worry a lot about economic recessions, but an
     <strong>
      ecological
     </strong>
     <strong>
      recession
     </strong>
     could have even worse consequences – and the biodiversity damage we've had means we're at risk of that happening. Until and unless we can bring biodiversity back up, we're playing
     <strong>
      ecological roulette
     </strong>
     ."

    </p>
    <p>
     1. Why is the existence of many species of animals and plants important for humans?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because many species take part in natural processes which guarantee that ecosystems work well and keep giving us food, fibres and fuel.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. True or false?
     <em>
      If 10% of the species in any ecosystem disappear, everything will go badly wrong there.
      <br/>
     </em>
     <strong>
      False. Ecosystems are different and this percentage is just a reference set up by scientists. And things don't go wrong immediately, according to Professor Andy Purvis.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. How much of the Earth's land cover houses almost three-quarters of the world's population?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      About 71% of the global population live in 58% of the world's land cover.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. What idea does Professor Purvis want to convey when using the expression 'ecological roulette'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Professor Purvis wants to convey the idea that human societies take a great risk in a deadly game.
     </strong>
    </p>
