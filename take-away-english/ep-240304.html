     你听说过心理学上的 “邓宁-克鲁格效应” 吗？它指一些人由于对自身能力和知识的局限性缺乏认知，因此会高估自己的水平，从而表现得过度自信。与之相反的情况则是 “智性谦逊”。它指一些人了解并承认自己在能力和知识上的局限性，因此可以更准确地判断自己的水平。本期 “随身英语” 讨论为什么我们应该了解自身能力的局限性。

     Humans can be poor
     <strong>
      judges
     </strong>
     of their own ability. So, you might not be as good, or as bad, as you think you are. Psychologists have found the less
     <strong>
      expertise
     </strong>
     you have in something, the more likely you are to
     <strong>
      overestimate
     </strong>
     your
     <strong>
      competence
     </strong>
     in it. And in a digital era where
     <strong>
      self-assured
     </strong>
     social media influencers give you 'life hacks', and face-to-face conversation is more limited, this psychological
     <strong>
      phenomenon
     </strong>
     seems important to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
     This concept is called the Dunning-Kruger effect, named after the psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger. Back in the 90s, they found a correlation between a person's
     <strong>
      lack
     </strong>
     of skills and ability and a lack of awareness of lack of ability. They are
     <strong>
      ignorant
     </strong>
     to their own
     <strong>
      limitations
     </strong>
     . This plays out in various areas of life, such as in medical diagnosis. For example, Dunning told BBC Radio 4 that, one third of the time, doctors disagree with patients who self-diagnose using internet sources rather than seeing a medical professional. Whether it's judging jokes, logical reasoning, or grammar, the pattern is the same: the less
     <strong>
      skilled
     </strong>
     you are, the more
     <strong>
      over-confident
     </strong>
     you are.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the flip side is
     <strong>
      intellectual
     </strong>
     <strong>
      humility
     </strong>
     . This means having a
     <strong>
      modest
     </strong>
     or low view of your importance or abilities. Elizabeth J. Krumrei-Mancuso, Professor of Psychology at Pepperdine University, found that a higher
     <strong>
      willingness
     </strong>
     to acknowledge cognitive limitations, and the ability to embrace diverse
     <strong>
      perspectives
     </strong>
     , is connected with a more accurate perception of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
     How can we use this knowledge to help us in everyday life? Tenelle Porter, a psychologist at Rowan University, told the BBC that knowing this "opens us up to being intellectually
     <strong>
      humble
     </strong>
     , to admitting everything that we don't yet know". And current studies suggest that those with higher intellectual humility are more open to negotiating, compromising and exploring information.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, embrace the unknown and remember, there's always more to learn.
