     新冠肺炎疫情期间，很多人在家工作，随之，决定开始养狗的人越来越多。虽然有个能陪伴自己的宠物听起来很美好，但从买狗到到养狗都需重视动物福利，不能只有三分钟热度。本文就此展开讨论。

    <p>
     For some people, there’s no better
     <strong>
      companion
     </strong>
     than
     <strong>
      man’s best friend
     </strong>
     – a dog. This four-legged
     <strong>
      canine
     </strong>
     can bring comfort and joy and provide much-needed exercise for you when it needs walkies! This probably explains why dog ownership increased last year because people spent more time at home during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was demand for
     <strong>
      puppies
     </strong>
     in particular that saw the biggest increase. Who couldn’t resist their playful personalities, adorable eyes, and super-soft
     <strong>
      coats
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     However, as demand for a new
     <strong>
      pooch
     </strong>
     increased, so did the price tag. Popular
     <strong>
      breeds
     </strong>
     , such as
     <strong>
      Cockapoos
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      Cocker Spaniels
     </strong>
     , saw even sharper price increases, and puppies have been selling for £3,000 or more.
    </p>
    <p>
     Animal welfare charities fear that high prices could encourage
     <strong>
      puppy farming
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      smuggling
     </strong>
     or dog theft. And a BBC investigation found some
     <strong>
      breeders
     </strong>
     have been selling puppies and kittens on social media sites – something charities have called “extremely
     <strong>
      irresponsible
     </strong>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     But despite some new owners purchasing a dog
     <strong>
      legally
     </strong>
     , maybe from a
     <strong>
      rescue centre
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      registered
     </strong>
     breeder, they’ve proved to be ill-prepared for life with a new
     <strong>
      pet
     </strong>
     , and the pet itself has found it hard to come to terms with life in a new home.
     <strong>
      Animal behaviourists
     </strong>
     in the UK have reported a surge in requests to help dogs suffering from
     <strong>
      fear-aggression
     </strong>
     after their
     <strong>
      lives have been turned upside down
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking to the future, there are concerns about the welfare of these much-loved pets. Ian Atkin, manager of the Oxfordshire Animal Sanctuary in the UK, told the BBC: “At the moment, the dogs are having a great time, but
     <strong>
      separation anxiety
     </strong>
     could still surface when people go back to work.” And Claire Calder from the UK’s Dogs Trust rescue charity says “the economic situation also means that some people may find they can’t afford to look after a dog.” The message is not to buy a puppy in haste and to pick one that fits into your lifestyle.
