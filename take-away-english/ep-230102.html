     创造力是一种至关重要的能力，但如何才能更好地激发创造力？有一些人认为，感到无聊其实有助于萌生创意，而另一些人则建议我们勇于尝试更多的新事物，增加阅历，从而提升创造力。本期 “随身英语” 围绕如何提升创造力展开讨论。

      词汇：creativity 创造力
     </strong>

    <p>
     Do you get your best ideas when you are bored, or when you are out doing new things? What should we look for when we want to be more
     <strong>
      creative
     </strong>
     ? Boredom and
     <strong>
      stimulus
     </strong>
     may be opposites, but studies into creativity suggest that actually we might need both.
    </p>
    <p>
     Writing for BBC Culture, Clair Thorp looks at the role that boredom plays in the
     <strong>
      creative process
     </strong>
     . Many writers and artists credit being bored with helping them have their best ideas – JK Rowling
     <strong>
      came up with
     </strong>
     Harry Potter while on a long train journey. Thorp tells us how some researchers believe that boredom
     <strong>
      drives
     </strong>
     our brains to find something to do – leading to
     <strong>
      creative ideas
     </strong>
     . So, maybe we should take the advice of the
     <strong>
      musician
     </strong>
     Questlove and learn to ignore the
     <strong>
      distractions
     </strong>
     that we can find on our phones.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, before we all start
     <strong>
      planning
     </strong>
     how to bore ourselves into creativity, Sandi Mann, an academic and author, warns that too much boredom can take away the
     <strong>
      energy
     </strong>
     we need for creativity. Many experts talk about the importance of finding new
     <strong>
      experiences
     </strong>
     in order to be more creative. Actor and writer Kayode Ewumi recommends getting on a random bus and seeing where you end up or learning a new musical instrument as ways to avoid
     <strong>
      writer's block
     </strong>
     . Professor Gerard Puccio, a professor of creativity studies, believes that having to look at new things, or old things
     <strong>
      in
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a different light
     </strong>
     , can force us to make
     <strong>
      unusual
     </strong>
     connections and come up with
     <strong>
      innovative
     </strong>
     solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, perhaps what we need is a balance – enough stimulus to make us look at things in different ways, and enough boredom to give us the
     <strong>
      breathing space
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      work through
     </strong>
     these thoughts.
