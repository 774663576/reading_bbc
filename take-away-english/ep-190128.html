     幸福是什么？研究认为，在西方文化中，个人的愉悦感是公认的幸福定义。而在东亚文化中，人们倾向于将社会和谐视为幸福。在非洲和印度的一些地区，幸福感更多地与共享体验和家庭相连接。本集内容讨论人们对幸福的追求，以及人们可以在何处找到幸福。

     How are you feeling today? Our emotions can vary considerably depending on many factors, including our health, wealth, relationships and where we live. But sometimes we need to take a step back and think about what happiness really means and how we can find it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe we should
     <strong>
      take a leaf out of
     </strong>
     Finland's
     <strong>
      book
     </strong>
     – last year the UN's World Happiness Report found the country to be the happiest place on Earth. The report looked at 'subjective
     <strong>
      well-being'
     </strong>
     . That's how happy people feel they are and why - based on factors such as, economic strength, social support, life expectancy, freedom of choice,
     <strong>
      generosity
     </strong>
     , and perceived corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is just one way of measuring happiness. Research has also suggested that while personal feelings of
     <strong>
      pleasure
     </strong>
     are the accepted definition of happiness in Western cultures, East Asian cultures tend to see happiness as
     <strong>
      social harmony
     </strong>
     , and in some parts of Africa and India it's more about shared experiences and family.
    </p>
    <p>
     Author and journalist Helen Russell has been looking at the positive characteristics of a country's population to see what makes them happy and found Japan to be one of the most
     <strong>
      content
     </strong>
     . She told the BBC that this was due to their
     <strong>
      concept
     </strong>
     of wabi-sabi – "this traditional Japanese concept around celebrating
     <strong>
      imperfection
     </strong>
     … it's this idea that there is a beauty in
     <strong>
      ageing
     </strong>
     , it's to be celebrated rather than trying to disguise it." So, basically, we should be happy with who we are and rejoice in our
     <strong>
      faults
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      individuality
     </strong>
     . That's something to put a smile on our faces!
    </p>
    <p>
     But if you're feeling
     <strong>
      down in the dumps
     </strong>
     because your home country doesn't have a happiness concept to follow, consider some self-help ideas that the BBC programme Hacking Happiness has been looking into. These include being
     <strong>
      virtuous
     </strong>
     , finding something
     <strong>
      to be passionate about
     </strong>
     , enjoying the here and now and being
     <strong>
      altruistic
     </strong>
     – helping others.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, our pursuit of happiness could make us
     <strong>
      miserable
     </strong>
     as we try to meet society’s expectations and goals, making us
     <strong>
      anxious
     </strong>
     and stressed. Also, having too little experience of negative emotions can make us less
     <strong>
      adept
     </strong>
     at facing new challenges.
