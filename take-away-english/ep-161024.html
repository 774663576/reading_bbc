     研究显示，有一个体积较大的大脑可能是造成一些大型哺乳动物灭绝的原因之一。这是因为大脑工作时需要消耗许多能量，再加上大脑体积大的动物通常有着较长的妊娠期，这也就意味着它们繁殖得很慢。本期《随身英语》探讨大体积大脑所引起的困扰。

     Is it possible to be too clever? Could it be that a big brain is actually a dangerous
     <strong>
      asset
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Whilst the
     <strong>
      brainy
     </strong>
     human species
     <strong>
      goes
     </strong>
     <strong>
      from strength to strength
     </strong>
     , a study suggests that having an abundance of
     <strong>
      grey matter
     </strong>
     directly increases the risk of extinction in our mammal cousins.
    </p>
    <p>
     Biologist Manuela Gonzalez-Suarez, from the University of Reading, says that big brains come with a clear
     <strong>
      downside
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     "The cost is too high," she told BBC Future. They require a lot of energy to grow and maintain. Large-brained animals also have longer
     <strong>
      gestational periods
     </strong>
     , meaning they produce fewer
     <strong>
      offspring
     </strong>
     . And their
     <strong>
      young
     </strong>
     need greater parental attention until they become independent.
    </p>
    <p>
     These
     <strong>
      traits
     </strong>
     mean "populations cannot grow fast, or quickly compensate for additional
     <strong>
      mortality
     </strong>
     ," she says.
    </p>
    <p>
     In short, big brains are an investment not all animals can afford. And this
     <strong>
      precarious
     </strong>
     situation is made worse by the fact that many large mammals are themselves the target of
     <strong>
      poaching
     </strong>
     or live in threatened
     <strong>
      habitats
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Some animals have long since decided that brains weren’t necessary. BBC Future suggests that sponges
     <strong>
      evolved
     </strong>
     to lose their brains over time, as they offered no tangible benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what about humans? We are the most intelligent
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     on Earth. We have
     <strong>
      tamed
     </strong>
     the natural environment, developed incredible technologies, and settled across almost every corner of the planet. But all this may be
     <strong>
      exacerbating
     </strong>
     the problem for other species.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gonzalez-Suarez says: "It is our collective responsibility as scientists who study
     <strong>
      megafauna
     </strong>
     to act to prevent their decline." Time to put our big brains to good use.

     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     1. Why are big brains 'expensive'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Big brains cost both energy and time.
     </strong>
     <strong>
      They require energy to grow and maintain. Animals with big brains also require a longer time in the womb and being cared for by their parents.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Which phrase means 'shared duty'?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Collective responsibility.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. What does Gonzales-Suarez believe the scientific community should do about large animals?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      She believes scientists should work together to prevent the decline of megafauna.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Why did sponges lose their brains?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      According to the article, having a brain offered insufficient benefits for sponges.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. True or false?
     <em>
      Mammals with big brains increase the risk of extinction for humans.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False: Humans increase the risk of extinction for large mammals.
