     Do you like drinking coffee? I certainly do. In fact you could say I'm an
     <strong>
      addict
     </strong>
     because I have to drink a cup every morning to
     <strong>
      kick-start
     </strong>
     my day and get my brain working! Latte, cappuccino, espresso – you name it, I'll drink it. And I'm not alone – it seems like everyone has a coffee cup glued to their hands as they rush to the office. So how would we survive if there was a
     <strong>
      coffee
     </strong>
     <strong>
      drought
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, experts are warning that our favourite caffeine shot could really be under threat. Our love for coffee could mean that demand
     <strong>
      outstrips
     </strong>
     supply. This, of course, could
     <strong>
      hit us in the pocket
     </strong>
     but there's even worse news – we could face poorer-tasting coffee. This is the view of scientists at London's Kew Gardens who are blaming
     <strong>
      global warming
     </strong>
     for this possible hot
     <strong>
      beverage
     </strong>
     crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
     Demand for coffee has certainly increased as people have become more
     <strong>
      affluent
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Consumption
     </strong>
     has doubled in the last 35 years. Last year 9.5 billion kilos were consumed. But as we drink more, the areas where coffee is grown is predicted to shrink. The International Coffee Organisation says that bean production in South East Asia, for example, will decrease by 70% by 2050. The BBC spoke to Dr Tim Schilling, director of the World Coffee Research institute, who says: "The supply of high-quality coffee is severely threatened by climate change, diseases and pests, land pressure, and labour shortages - and demand for these coffees is rising every year."
    </p>
    <p>
     This is a
     <strong>
      sobering
     </strong>
     thought for those of us who rely on a
     <strong>
      caffeine fix
     </strong>
     everyday but more worrying for people who work in the industry. Coffee provides a
     <strong>
      livelihood
     </strong>
     for about 16% of Ethiopia's population. And across the globe, extreme weather events are proving a challenge to coffee growers in places such as Brazil and Vietnam.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is some hope. Technology is helping to protect the future of coffee such as '
     <strong>
      breeding
     </strong>
     ' the Arabica bean plants to increase its
     <strong>
      diversity
     </strong>
     and making it
     <strong>
      resistant
     </strong>
     to climatic changes. It's also possible to relocate the coffee-growing areas – although this sometimes leads to areas being deforested. Dr Aaron Davis, coffee researcher at Kew, says: “There is the potential to
     <strong>
      mitigate
     </strong>
     some of the negatives and actually increase the coffee-growing area by four and a half times compared with maintaining the
     <strong>
      status quo
     </strong>
     .” But will this come quick enough before our coffee turns bitter and we look for a cheaper alternative?
