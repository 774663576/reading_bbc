     你有没有过这种感受：吃了一点零食，感到自责？买了新衣服穿，觉得自己乱花钱？明明是在享受一件让自己感到快乐的事情，却不禁认为这是在自我纵容而深感内疚。不妨换个角度想一想，把你适当犒劳自己的行为看作是一种自我呵护、促进身心健康的方式。听 “随身英语” 节目围绕这一话题展开讨论。

     <strong>
      词汇：guilty pleasures 让人有负罪感的乐事
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     You might have heard of the expression 'a guilty pleasure' – maybe it's the chocolate bar you buy on the way home from work, or the new clothes that you don't really need. It comes from the idea that when we
     <strong>
      treat
     </strong>
     ourselves, it can sometimes leave us feeling guilty. Perhaps we don't feel we
     <strong>
      deserved
     </strong>
     it, or we don't think it was a
     <strong>
      responsible
     </strong>
     way to spend our money. But should we feel like this? Do we really have to feel guilty about treating ourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
     Perhaps not. Psychologists have suggested that buying things for yourself can make you feel better as it provides an opportunity to take control of your situation. It can give you
     <strong>
      social contact
     </strong>
     as well as a
     <strong>
      confidence boost
     </strong>
     from changes you make to your
     <strong>
      self-image
     </strong>
     . It may be that as well as
     <strong>
      lifting your mood
     </strong>
     , when you buy a treat, you might just be
     <strong>
      looking after
     </strong>
     yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, there are also examples of people turning to
     <strong>
      destructive behaviour
     </strong>
     when faced with
     <strong>
      stressful
     </strong>
     circumstances. People might spend money that they don't have or turn to dangerous
     <strong>
      addictions
     </strong>
     . Psychologist Leon Seltzer considers the difference between
     <strong>
      self-indulgence
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      self-nurturing
     </strong>
     . Self-indulgence can be
     <strong>
      reckless
     </strong>
     and have negative
     <strong>
      consequences
     </strong>
     , while self-nurturing is taking responsible decisions to
     <strong>
      satisfy
     </strong>
     our needs and take care of ourselves in ways that don't have a significant impact.
    </p>
    <p>
     One stress that people may need to deal with is exam stress. Many universities publish guides with advice for
     <strong>
      coping
     </strong>
     <strong>
      with
     </strong>
     exam stress. Reflecting the difference between self-indulgence and self-nurture, they recommend
     <strong>
      rewarding
     </strong>
     yourself for your efforts, doing things that you enjoy and are good at so that you can feel
     <strong>
      accomplishment
     </strong>
     and to avoid things that may make you feel worse afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
     So perhaps, as long as we make responsible decisions, we shouldn't feel guilty about our guilty pleasures.
