     Have you ever heard someone say, “breakfast is the most important meal of the day”, or give you advice about why it’s
     <strong>
      vital
     </strong>
     to start the day with a healthy breakfast? It seems that this
     <strong>
      feast
     </strong>
     , for many of us, is necessary for our day to start well, but is it really that important?
    </p>
    <p>
     The word ‘breakfast’ comes from ‘breaking the
     <strong>
      fast
     </strong>
     ’ – the idea of ending the period in which we didn’t eat during the night. The
     <strong>
      regeneration
     </strong>
     process that takes place while we sleep
     <strong>
      consumes
     </strong>
     some of our natural
     <strong>
      food
     </strong>
     <strong>
      reserves
     </strong>
     to heal our bodies. Breakfast gives us an opportunity to
     <strong>
      replenish
     </strong>
     those
     <strong>
      depleted
     </strong>
     stores of things like
     <strong>
      protein
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      calcium
     </strong>
     . So, in that way, a healthy breakfast makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are also many often-quoted studies which seem to
     <strong>
      correlate
     </strong>
     a state of obesity with
     <strong>
      skipping
     </strong>
     breakfast. In fact, it leads many health experts to advise a healthy breakfast to not only
     <strong>
      regulate
     </strong>
     but also lose weight. In a US study, 50,000 people were monitored over seven years, and those who ate a healthy breakfast were found to have a lower
     <strong>
      BMI
     </strong>
     , which seems to suggest that breakfast may indeed help people maintain a healthy weight.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it might not be as simple as that. Some experts, like Alexandra Johnstone, professor of
     <strong>
      appetite
     </strong>
     research at the University of Aberdeen, suggest those who skip breakfast might be less aware of healthy diets and nutrition, and people who eat breakfast might have a healthier lifestyle overall – exercising and not smoking, for example. And with the rise in popularity of
     <strong>
      intermittent
     </strong>
     fasting to lose weight – there may also be some benefits to skipping breakfast. Intermittent fasting can improve blood sugar control,
     <strong>
      insulin
     </strong>
     sensitivity, and lower
     <strong>
      blood pressure
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while breakfast has its benefits, it might not be the most important meal. It seems that a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet might be more important for many of us than just one single meal.
