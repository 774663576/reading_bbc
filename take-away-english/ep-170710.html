    <p>
     It’s very common these days for people to have a
     <strong>
      gym
     </strong>
     <strong>
      regime
     </strong>
     . Whatever the drive behind it, whether health-related, performance-related or just plain
     <strong>
      vainglory
     </strong>
     , it is not uncommon for people to take some sort of regular exercise each week.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if you’ve never done it before, what’s the best way to go about it? Well, many people make use of a PT – that’s a personal trainer. This might be because they’re
     <strong>
      wet behind the ears
     </strong>
     or maybe they just don’t want the
     <strong>
      aggro
     </strong>
     of designing their own workout plan. A PT will create a
     <strong>
      bespoke
     </strong>
     plan for you based on your aims. They will tailor it to your current abilities and, better still, they will teach you how to move in a way that won’t
     <strong>
      incapacitate
     </strong>
     you.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, the
     <strong>
      trade-off
     </strong>
     with a PT is the price. Each hourly session can be
     <strong>
      steep
     </strong>
     considering the
     <strong>
      double whammy
     </strong>
     of having to pay both the PT and membership of the gym, too. If you are at all
     <strong>
      strapped for cash
     </strong>
     then regular sessions might be out of your budget.
    </p>
    <p>
     So what’s left? Well, if you have the grit for it, you can make your own regime. It’s relatively easy to do if you have the
     <strong>
      know-how
     </strong>
     . But before you do, here are some basic pointers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     First, keep your fitness goal in mind. Are you looking to
     <strong>
      slim down
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      bulk up
     </strong>
     , get
     <strong>
      shredded
     </strong>
     or increase your abilities? Whatever it is, make sure the things you choose to do are in pursuit of that goal. Next, do your research. These days, social media is chock-full of fitness videos and advice. Watch as many of these as possible, but make sure to be a little critical of them – everyone has a different
     <strong>
      physique
     </strong>
     and what works for one may not work for another. Finally,
     <strong>
      keep your feet on the ground
     </strong>
     . Be patient with yourself and set realistic goals – it takes at least three months to see any realistic body changes. And don’t be
     <strong>
      overzealous
     </strong>
     – never work in pain – a good workout is difficult and challenging, but never painful. Pain means you are damaging yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
     If nothing else, focus on
     <strong>
      calisthenics
     </strong>
     – these are the basic body movements which everyone can do anywhere, even at home. They include
     <strong>
      squats
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      push-ups
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      pull-ups
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      crunches
     </strong>
     , among other things. Do as many of one exercise as you can without stopping, and then try and repeat that number twice more – make sure you sweat, and don’t forget to rest for a minute in between!
