      I'll be working this Christmas. My job?
      <strong>
       Santa Claus
      </strong>
      ! White beard and red clothes are optional. I'll be joining thousands of
      <strong>
       volunteers
      </strong>
      in Britain who go and help
      <strong>
       homeless
      </strong>
      and elderly people as well as poor children.

      <strong>
       Solidarity
      </strong>
     </span>
     <span>
      comes to life at this time of the year. It's cold and many people feel lonely. I'll
      <strong>
       be there for them
      </strong>
      . I was inspired by a woman in Scotland -
     </span>
     <span>
      Beatrice Cadell has just celebrated her 80th
     </span>
     <span>
      birthday and instead of presents for her, she asked her friends to buy toys. They'll be
     </span>
     <span>
      <strong>
       donated
      </strong>
      to a toy bank - free toys for children whose parents can't afford to buy them any.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Cadell said: "Everyone that turned up to my birthday
      <strong>
       do
      </strong>
      was absolutely brilliant! Somebody else can
      <strong>
       benefit
      </strong>
      . We don't need it. We're old."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      There are plenty of places which welcome
      <strong>
       a helping hand
      </strong>
      at Christmas. The
      <strong>
       charity
      </strong>
      Crisis at Christmas, for example, has been looking for more than 10,000 volunteers to
      <strong>
       assist
      </strong>
      guests in their centres for homeless people. Volunteers with specialist skills like dentists, hairdressers, lorry drivers and performers are particularly welcome.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Another organisation, Community Christmas, is keen on volunteers who wish to offer
      <strong>
       companionship
      </strong>
      to lonely, elderly people on Christmas Day – it can be over a full lunch or just a cup of tea. They have a website with a location page so that
      <strong>
       good Samaritans
      </strong>
      can register their interest in helping out and find out more.

      Scrooge is a character very much associated with this time of year. He's the central figure in A Christmas Carol, a classic by the English writer Charles Dickens
      <strong>
       . Scrooge
      </strong>
      is a selfish man who only helps himself. In the world of
      <strong>
       volunteering
      </strong>
      , there's no Scrooge in sight. We're all proud and happy Santas. Merry Christmas!
