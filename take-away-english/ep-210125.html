     蜘蛛、飞行、看牙医…… 这些都是可能让我们感到惧怕的事情。因为无法控制这种恐惧感，久而久之，就产生了恐惧症。本文讨论让人产生恐惧的原因以及应如何控制自己的情绪。

    <p>
     What are the things that
     <strong>
      scare
     </strong>
     you: snakes, spiders or creepy crawlies? Or maybe you have
     <strong>
      a fear of
     </strong>
     heights or visiting the dentist. Although some of us just get scared or a bit nervous about these things, for others it can cause an
     <strong>
      irrational
     </strong>
     reaction that can’t be controlled – something we call a phobia. It occurs when someone develops an exaggerated or unrealistic
     <strong>
      sense of danger
     </strong>
     about a situation or object.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sometimes it’s good to be aware of the possible dangers from things. Our brain alerts us to the risks that might lie ahead, but then we often
     <strong>
      rationalise
     </strong>
     the risks and
     <strong>
      overcome
     </strong>
     them. Clinical psychologist Warren Mansell told the BBC: “Our fears are
     <strong>
      hard-wired
     </strong>
     into our brains – we don’t need to learn to be afraid of animals like snakes or spiders.” But phobias are stronger than just fears. Warren says: “An area called the
     <strong>
      amygdala
     </strong>
     in the brain is recognising a
     <strong>
      threat
     </strong>
     and preparing your body for
     <strong>
      fight or flight
     </strong>
     .” With a phobia, your
     <strong>
      breathing
     </strong>
     gets quicker, your
     <strong>
      pulse
     </strong>
     speeds up, you
     <strong>
      sweat
     </strong>
     , there’s more glucose in your blood, increasing your energy, and your brain is unable to control these reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
     But where does a phobia come from? Speaking to the BBC, Lauren Rosenberg, a fear and phobia expert, says: “Phobias usually are a copy behaviour from a higher authority, like a parent or teacher, or something you have learnt from your own experience.” Or a
     <strong>
      trauma
     </strong>
     from a past event that comes back to
     <strong>
      haunt
     </strong>
     you.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many different complex phobias some people suffer from, such as
     <strong>
      agoraphobia
     </strong>
     –
     <strong>
      triggered
     </strong>
     by being away from home,
     <strong>
      social anxiety disorder
     </strong>
     – feeling anxious in social situations, and
     <strong>
      iatrophobia
     </strong>
     – fear of doctors. But how can they be overcome?
     <strong>
      Cognitive behavioural therapy
     </strong>
     is one option, where you gradually get used to whatever it is you fear. Lauren Rosenburg says she likes to work with people to clear their
     <strong>
      subconscious
     </strong>
     memory and help them breathe. But if you do have a phobia, continually trying to avoid what you’re afraid of is likely to make the situation worse, so it’s a good idea to find help to overcome it.

    <p>
     1. What do we normally do to overcome something we might fear?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      We rationalise the risks and overcome them.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. How might we develop a phobia?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      A phobia can develop from copying the behaviour from a higher authority, like a parent or teacher. It could be something you have learnt from your own experience, or from a trauma you experienced in the past.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. When we have a phobia, what happens to our breathing?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      With a phobia, our breathing gets quicker.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. True or false?
     <em>
      Social anxiety disorder is a fear of feeling anxious.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. Social anxiety disorder refers to feeling anxious in social situations.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Why should you not continually avoid what you’re afraid of?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because continually trying to avoid what you’re afraid of is likely to make the situation worse.
