     There are many ways we can enjoy sport – watching it on TV or a smartphone, attending an event at a stadium or even playing the game. But for those who enjoy getting
     <strong>
      competitive
     </strong>
     with their computer gaming, there are realistic-looking games with
     <strong>
      lifelike graphics
     </strong>
     to be played without leaving home. It’s this type of sport – if that’s what we can call it – that has become big business. And interest in it has gone to a new level.
    </p>
    <p>
     Initially, grabbing a
     <strong>
      joystick
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      controller
     </strong>
     and playing a game was a
     <strong>
      solitary
     </strong>
     activity. But around 20 years ago computers became cheaper and the internet became faster, which made it much easier for more people to get involved with computer gaming. This led to
     <strong>
      gamers
     </strong>
     connecting with each other around the world, so they could go
     <strong>
      head-to-head
     </strong>
     online. It also became a
     <strong>
      spectator sport
     </strong>
     , with people watching others play. The whole experience has been given the name ‘
     <strong>
      esports
     </strong>
     ’ – electronic sports.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, huge esports
     <strong>
      tournaments
     </strong>
     take place all over the world in big arenas with large crowds.
     <strong>
      Die-hard
     </strong>
     enthusiasts, who have become
     <strong>
      first-rate
     </strong>
     <strong>
      players
     </strong>
     , are now well-known - some play together in teams. Its top stars can earn millions of dollars a year, without even breaking into a sweat!  And fans from around the world tune in to watch the action online. The global audience is now estimated at more than 200 million and growing. Annual
     <strong>
      revenues
     </strong>
     from esports, currently around 650 million dollars for events, continue to rise with billions more generated through video games sales.
    </p>
    <p>
     Famous football clubs are now trying to
     <strong>
      get in on the action
     </strong>
     . England’s Football Association for example launched its first esports team this year, known as the eLions. It recruited
     <em>
      Fifa 19
     </em>
     players to represent them at the
     <strong>
      inaugural
     </strong>
     Fifa eNations Cup. Mark Bullingham, the FA's chief commercial and football development officer, said "The FA prides itself on being a modern,
     <strong>
      innovative
     </strong>
     organisation that strives to engage and
     <strong>
      inspire
     </strong>
     all generations of football fans."
    </p>
    <p>
     But while this
     <strong>
      virtual
     </strong>
     version of football might give aspiring footballers a chance to get closer to the real game, some might argue the lack of
     <strong>
      physical activity
     </strong>
     means it shouldn’t be called a sport – and the biggest winners are the companies who promote and sell esports.
