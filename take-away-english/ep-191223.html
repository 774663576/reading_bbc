     一项新研究表明，我们参加的会议数量比以往任何时候都多，所以花在听和说上的时间也比实际工作的时间要多。那么，这些会议都是有必要开的吗？开会的目的是什么？是用来讨论工作、做决策？还是与同事建立友好关系、聊天的好时机？“随身英语” 讨论工作会议的三两事。

     It’s time for another meeting! If you have a job, the chances are some of your working week will be taken up attending a few of them. You and your
     <strong>
      colleagues
     </strong>
     will gather together in a meeting room, be
     <strong>
      talked at
     </strong>
     for an hour and come out wondering what was the point of it? Of course, it is sometimes necessary to meet to discuss things, share information,
     <strong>
      voice your opinion
     </strong>
     and agree a way forward – but are there any other benefits?
    </p>
    <p>
     Recent research has suggested that we attend more meeting than ever before – and that's more time listening and talking than actually doing our jobs. Professor Patrik Hall from the University of Malmo told the BBC that this is partly due to more “meetings-intense”
     <strong>
      roles
     </strong>
     such as
     <strong>
      managerial
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      strategy
     </strong>
     jobs. These require more meetings with teams and other
     <strong>
      stakeholders.
     </strong>
     But, he says, despite there being more of them, "few decisions are made".
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s possible that it’s managers on a
     <strong>
      power trip
     </strong>
     who set up these meetings – a way of controlling
     <strong>
      staff
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      imposing
     </strong>
     new rules and regulations and
     <strong>
      asserting
     </strong>
     their
     <strong>
      authority
     </strong>
     . But as Professor Hall points out: "Many managers don't know what to do," and when they are "unsure of their role", they respond by generating more meetings. And to make matters worse, some meetings involve a pre or post-meeting which eats into even more of the working day.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the researchers from the University of Malmo have found that a meeting can be seen as a form of ‘
     <strong>
      therapy
     </strong>
     ’ – it doesn’t have to have an outcome and doesn’t have to be meaningless. So, if you’re just
     <strong>
      doodling
     </strong>
     or glancing at your smartphone as your boss
     <strong>
      drones on
     </strong>
     , it’s worth considering that a meeting can be an opportunity to demonstrate your
     <strong>
      talents
     </strong>
     , express
     <strong>
      frustration
     </strong>
     , question ideas and spend time
     <strong>
      bonding
     </strong>
     with your colleagues.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are a few things to be considered if a meeting is to be a success: it needs an
     <strong>
      agenda
     </strong>
     that is
     <strong>
      adhered
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     plus an opportunity to discuss any other business, and it should be booked for a short period of time – otherwise the meeting will expand to fit the time that’s been allocated. And, as Professor Hall says, the “equality” of
     <strong>
      participants
     </strong>
     is important. But I think I just prefer the advice of Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, who urged colleagues to walk out of meetings as soon as it becomes obvious that they are not
     <strong>
      adding value
     </strong>
     . "It's not rude to leave," he explains. "It's rude to make someone stay and waste their time." Right, I’m off!
