     Over half of American TV viewers now use subtitles whenever they watch TV, according to survey company YouGov. This trend is even more noticeable in
     <strong>
      viewers
     </strong>
     under 30. Subtitles have long been used to help people with
     <strong>
      hearing impairments
     </strong>
     or to allow people to watch films in a different language, but why has their use become so widespread?
    </p>
    <p>
     The reasons for this are both technical and social. Advances in
     <strong>
      digital sound production
     </strong>
     and microphones mean that actors can be more
     <strong>
      natural
     </strong>
     in their
     <strong>
      vocal performance
     </strong>
     , while at the same time
     <strong>
      audio directors
     </strong>
     are able to make more and more
     <strong>
      dramatic soundscapes
     </strong>
     . Combined with the much smaller speakers contained in modern TV sets, this can all make
     <strong>
      dialogue
     </strong>
     seem
     <strong>
      unintelligible
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Smartphones may play a role. We are used to subtitled social media videos that can be watched without headphones. Smartphones also allow us to watch film and TV in public places where they are not easily
     <strong>
      audible
     </strong>
     .  Another social reason could be the increased appetite for programmes in other languages accessible through international streaming services.
    </p>
    <p>
     While some viewers may consider subtitles to be
     <strong>
      distracting
     </strong>
     , or worry about the potential for
     <strong>
      spoilers
     </strong>
     , they don't just help with
     <strong>
      unclear
     </strong>
     audio. A number of studies have suggested that subtitles could help people to increase their vocabulary and boost their listening skills in languages that they do not currently speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     This may be particularly effective when subtitles are in the same language as the
     <strong>
      audio track
     </strong>
     of the programme.
     <strong>
      Same-language subtitles
     </strong>
     have also been shown to help young children develop their reading skills in their first language, to the point where campaigners have suggested
     <strong>
      enabling
     </strong>
     subtitles on all children's programmes by default.
