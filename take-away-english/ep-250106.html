     数千年来，共同就餐是人类之间建立纽带的方式。作为狩猎采集者，在危机四伏的自然环境中一起捕猎、准备食物和烹饪能够为彼此提供保护。而在现代社会中，人们虽然已经不需要通过这些方式来保护自身，却依然保持了共同就餐的习惯。本文探讨与他人一起就餐有哪些好处。

     "Dinner's ready!" Do you recognise that familiar call for everyone to
     <strong>
      gather round
     </strong>
     the table and
     <strong>
      tuck in
     </strong>
     ? Whether it's a
     <strong>
      takeaway
     </strong>
     with friends or a family
     <strong>
      get-together
     </strong>
     during holiday seasons, humans have been eating together for thousands of years. But why?
    </p>
    <p>
     The discovery of fire may have kickstarted
     <strong>
      communal
     </strong>
     eating for our
     <strong>
      hunter-gatherer
     </strong>
     ancestors, according to primatologist Richard Wrangham. Cooking a meal all those years ago required a social group – you needed someone to hunt the food, someone to protect the food from thieves or predators, and of course, someone to cook. And once enjoying the
     <strong>
      feast
     </strong>
     , evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar speculates that the fire's bright light may have given the humans longer nights and provided great opportunities for
     <strong>
      bonding
     </strong>
     over food.
    </p>
    <p>
     But modern humans don't face the same threats as we used to – we can cook and eat a meal by ourselves. So why should we still make group meals a
     <strong>
      ritual
     </strong>
     ? In Dunbar's 2017 study 'Breaking Bread: the Functions of Social Eating', they found communal eating increased feelings of
     <strong>
      wellbeing
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      connectedness
     </strong>
     with the community. Despite this, the study found a third of weekday evening meals in the UK are eaten in
     <strong>
      isolation
     </strong>
     – the main cause being busy work schedules.
    </p>
    <p>
     Today's reality is that having meals together can be difficult. Time management,
     <strong>
      fussy
     </strong>
     eaters, and family
     <strong>
      tensions
     </strong>
     are all things that can get in the way. But, in an article about overthinking family meals, Susannah Ayre and colleagues write 'Five tips to ease the pressure', including dropping the need for perfection. "There is no shame in
     <strong>
      reheating
     </strong>
     a frozen meal" or "eating on a
     <strong>
      picnic
     </strong>
     rug in the living room".
    </p>
    <p>
     Sharing meals may look different today than it did for our ancestors, but the essence stays the same: food is more than just fuel. It can be a way to connect, share stories and strengthen bonds.
