     在忙碌的工作日中午休息一小段时间固然可以放松身心，然而很多人在午休前都面临一个难题——到底该吃什么？由于工作紧张而繁忙，大部分上班族都会在中午吃同一类食品，其实我们最好偶尔换一换口味。本季《随身英语》探讨可供选择的几种常见午餐类型。

    <p>
     Whether at school, college or work, most of us take some sort of lunch break. It's a good time to have a rest, catch up with friends and eat some food – but here lies the dilemma – what to eat? There are
     <strong>
      a feast
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of
     </strong>
     options but because of limited time or money, many of us stick to what we know – usually the
     <strong>
      humble
     </strong>
     sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some of us make our own sandwiches in the morning before heading out, whilst those in a rush tend to
     <strong>
      grab-and-go
     </strong>
     at a snack bar or a cafe or buy a
     <strong>
      meal deal
     </strong>
     at a supermarket. A packet of crisps may be an additional
     <strong>
      staple
     </strong>
     to our predictable lunch. What we eat is usually the same everyday. Sheila Dillon from the BBC Food Programme says more than a third of office workers have eaten the same midday meal for the last nine months.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the UK, bread has become the
     <strong>
      mainstay
     </strong>
     of our lunchtime snack, sometimes eaten at your desk – a style known as '
     <strong>
      al-desko
     </strong>
     '. Bread is cheap and fills you up and with average lunch hours now reduced to 25 minutes, 24 seconds, it's quick and convenient to eat. But it's also boring! Some people have
     <strong>
      broken the mould
     </strong>
     by bringing in
     <strong>
      leftovers
     </strong>
     from their previous night's dinner, which they then heat up in a microwave but even that isn't very exciting.
    </p>
    <p>
     We are creatures of habit but philosopher Julian Baggini says "we’re never going to break out of our midday
     <strong>
      malaise
     </strong>
     unless we
     <strong>
      think outside the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      box
     </strong>
     ." There are alternatives that will fill you up. With just a microwave and a kettle, there a number of hot
     <strong>
      satisfying
     </strong>
     meals than can be made such as soups and jacket potatoes served with a
     <strong>
      dollop
     </strong>
     of baked beans or cheese. And then there are the
     <strong>
      ubiquitous
     </strong>
     instant noodles in a pot – although you may question how
     <strong>
      nutritious
     </strong>
     they are.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you've got time for more exotic
     <strong>
      munchies
     </strong>
     , then look out for trendy 'Ottolenghi' style food such as fava bean salad wrap. There is also the healthy Japanese style 'bento box' or lunchbox that normally contains a mix of
     <strong>
      carbohydrate
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      protein
     </strong>
     and vegetable. And of course another healthy Japanese treat is
     <strong>
      sushi
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But if I've got time for a proper lunch, I head to my local
     <strong>
      greasy spoon
     </strong>
     and tuck into a
     <strong>
      fry-up
     </strong>
     . Not very healthy but delicious and it sets me up for an afternoon of hard work. Then it's time for the next dilemma – what to have for dinner?! What do you usually eat for lunch?
