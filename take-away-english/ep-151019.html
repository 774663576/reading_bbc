     Brazilians certainly know how to
     <strong>
      throw a party
     </strong>
     – but will Rio be ready to welcome over 10,000 athletes and all the international visitors to the 2016 Olympics? At the moment, some natives of Rio (known locally as 'Cariocas') aren't too enthusiastic about the Games. They know they'll be putting up with a lot more roadworks and
     <strong>
      infrastructure
     </strong>
     building before the Olympic torch is lit in the Maracanã Stadium next August.
    </p>
    <p>
     Delays in
     <strong>
      venue
     </strong>
     construction gave the International Olympic Committee
     <strong>
      a fright
     </strong>
     in 2014. The government has since
     <strong>
      cleaned up its act
     </strong>
     and was praised recently for being ''
     <strong>
      on the right track
     </strong>
     '', although the challenge of cleaning up the highly polluted waters of the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon and Guanabara Bay – venues for the sailing and rowing competitions – remains.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fortunately, Brazil has learnt a lot from
     <strong>
      hosting
     </strong>
     the World Cup in 2014. Some businesses realised they were
     <strong>
      missing a trick
     </strong>
     by not communicating well with their international customers. Restaurants now know that using the internet to translate the menu isn't always a good idea: 'bife a cavalo' isn't really 'horse steak' – it's beef with a fried egg on top!
    </p>
    <p>
     Security was a key challenge in 2014 – and during the Olympics, the police will be working hard to prevent street crime. As with other developing countries, crime rates are high, and visitors will be encouraged to
     <strong>
      keep their wits about them
     </strong>
     so as to avoid falling victim to
     <strong>
      pickpockets
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      muggers
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So while the Cariocas are already becoming athletes – by jumping and running across construction sites on their daily commute – they know that the Games have the potential to be a great spectacle, they will be able to
     <strong>
      let their hair down
     </strong>
     , and international visitors will
     <strong>
      have a good time
     </strong>
     in their company.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even those Brazilians who have their
     <strong>
      reservations
     </strong>
     , know deep down something that others don't. An old local saying goes: 'Deus é Brasileiro' ('God is Brazilian'). They hope he will
     <strong>
      give them a hand
     </strong>
     to make the games a success. And you can be sure that whatever happens – or doesn't happen – Brazilians will show the world why they have such a reputation as party people!
