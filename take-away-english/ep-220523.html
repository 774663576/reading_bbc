     2022年4月，一项新法律在英国生效，要求餐馆和售卖食品的商铺必须标注菜肴的卡路里信息。计算每餐的卡路里总数可以帮助我们更好地控制摄入的热量，但这样做有没有坏处？本期节目讨论计算食物卡路里的利弊。

     Most of us want to be in
     <strong>
      peak
     </strong>
     physical condition, get
     <strong>
      in shape
     </strong>
     and be healthy. While some
     <strong>
      gym bunnies
     </strong>
     are more obsessed with looking
     <strong>
      ripped
     </strong>
     , for many of us
     <strong>
      nutrition
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      watching what you eat
     </strong>
     is a vital way to stay healthy. But when it comes to food, what is
     <strong>
      calorie
     </strong>
     counting, and what are the positives and negatives of it?
    </p>
    <p>
     A law in the UK came into force in April 2022 that requires large businesses such as restaurants, takeaways, and cafes to display the calorie information of non-pre-packed food and soft drinks on their menus. It’s a strategy aimed to tackle
     <strong>
      obesity
     </strong>
     and give people a more informed choice of what goes down their
     <strong>
      gullets
     </strong>
     . According to the NHS (National Health Service), generally, the recommended daily
     <strong>
      intake
     </strong>
     of calories for male adults is 2,500 per day, while female adults should
     <strong>
      consume
     </strong>
     2,000 to maintain their
     <strong>
      weight levels
     </strong>
     . For those of us who wish to
     <strong>
      drop
     </strong>
     <strong>
      a few pounds
     </strong>
     , experts advise us to consume fewer calories than the recommended daily number, eat a
     <strong>
      balanced diet
     </strong>
     , and increase our levels of
     <strong>
      physical activity
     </strong>
     . Being able to count calories and know how much we can eat is a great way to try and stay on track with our diet.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, there are some sceptics when it comes to calorie counting. 200 calories of fresh fruit and 200 calories of
     <strong>
      junk food
     </strong>
     , for example cookies, have the same caloric value. However, there is a question of the health benefits of what you’re consuming, regardless of calories. While fresh fruit like apples contains things like vitamin C, junk food could contain an unhealthy level of sugar and fats. Likewise, fruit may
     <strong>
      fill you up
     </strong>
     and leave you not
     <strong>
      craving
     </strong>
     more food for longer than a biscuit with equal calories – meaning, overall, you eat less. Simply counting calories, while useful for weight loss, doesn’t take into account your intake of good fats, carbohydrates, and proteins – things that your body needs. So, if you’re trying to stick to
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      low-carb
     </strong>
     <strong>
      diet
     </strong>
     , just looking at numbers of calories on a menu won’t be that useful. So, always be mindful that what you’re eating is part of a healthy balanced diet.
