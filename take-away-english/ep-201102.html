     社交网络的使用在人们的生活中变得越来越普及。在使用这些工具时，我们习惯性地过滤掉看到的广告，但是要想忽略我们最喜欢的名人向我们推销产品就没有那么容易了。名人为某商品代言的这种营销方式被称为 “社交媒体影响力”。本文讨论 “社交媒体影响力” 对个人购买行为的影响。

     Have you ever been on
     <strong>
      social media
     </strong>
     and seen your favourite
     <strong>
      celebrity
     </strong>
     talking about a product? These
     <strong>
      endorsements
     </strong>
     might not be totally random, and are actually seen as a vital part of the
     <strong>
      marketing
     </strong>
     process. The question is: How do
     <strong>
      social media influencers
     </strong>
     ‘influence’ what you buy?
    </p>
    <p>
     Human desire for status and making friends, combined with our need to belong to a group, make us susceptible to being ‘socially influenced’. Companies often use that desire to have a similar lifestyle to a celebrity we admire to
     <strong>
      hawk
     </strong>
     or launch a product. So, what do these endorsements actually do?
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, they can be used to build
     <strong>
      brand awareness
     </strong>
     . A social media influencer should have a strong understanding of the platform they operate on, and therefore can create
     <strong>
      engaging content
     </strong>
     that not only adheres to the
     <strong>
      brand image
     </strong>
     , but sparks their followers’ interests in a product they might never have seen before.
    </p>
    <p>
     Secondly, influencers can improve a company or product’s relationship with their
     <strong>
      customer base
     </strong>
     . According to InMoment’s 2018 US Retail CX Trends Report on
     <strong>
      customer loyalty
     </strong>
     , 77% of buyers have been brand loyal for more than ten years. This is also true of 60% of millennials. A popular celebrity can target key
     <strong>
      demographics
     </strong>
     and talk or
     <strong>
      blog
     </strong>
     about a product, which can create an instant and lasting
     <strong>
      bond
     </strong>
     with the consumer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lastly, influencers can improve customer
     <strong>
      buying habits
     </strong>
     with seemingly ‘unbiased opinions’. We are more likely to respond to ‘
     <strong>
      peer recommendation
     </strong>
     ’ than traditional ads, meaning the fact we see an influencer as a ‘friend’ can make us less likely to be sceptical about what we are seeing.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the next time you see a celebrity talking about a product, you might want to consider that this could be a carefully crafted marketing strategy designed to target your core needs. If you find yourself perusing a product you’ve seen on social media, you may well have been influenced.
