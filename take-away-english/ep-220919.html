     How would you survive without your smartphone? For many of us, it’s the gadget we’re most
     <strong>
      hooked
     </strong>
     on – looking at it hundreds of times a day. We
     <strong>
      depend on
     </strong>
     it to perform a multitude of tasks and to connect with our friends and family. But have we become
     <strong>
      addicted
     </strong>
     to our phones?
    </p>
    <p>
     Certainly, the inventor of the first mobile phone, American engineer Martin Cooper, thinks we might be. In a BBC interview, he suggested people should stop scrolling and “
     <strong>
      get a life
     </strong>
     ”. But of course, once we start
     <strong>
      doom scrolling
     </strong>
     or watching videos, we just can’t
     <strong>
      kick the habit
     </strong>
     . Psychologist and author Jean Twenge says we’re all guilty of “
     <strong>
      compulsively
     </strong>
     checking [our] phone if [we’re] waiting for a text or getting really into social media then kind of, looking up and realising that an hour has passed.” There’s even a word – a
     <strong>
      phubber
     </strong>
     – to describe a person who ignores the real people around them because they are concentrating on their phones.
    </p>
    <p>
     But does it matter if we make the most of this technology? Possibly, because like a drug, the problem arises when it is
     <strong>
      withdrawn
     </strong>
     . A study from King’s College London found young people they studied couldn’t control the amount of time they spend on their phone. Such
     <strong>
      addictive
     </strong>
     behaviour means that people become ‘
     <strong>
      panicky
     </strong>
     ’ or ‘upset’ if they are denied constant access, which can cause
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     and mental health issues.
    </p>
    <p>
     Interestingly, another study by the London School of Economics and Political Science suggests we don’t just look at our phones because we are prompted to by a text or email. The people they studied felt automatically
     <strong>
      urged
     </strong>
     to interact with their phone, just as a smoker would light a cigarette. Prof Saadi Lahlou, co-author of the study, told the BBC: “We must learn tricks to avoid the
     <strong>
      temptation
     </strong>
     when we want to concentrate or have good social relations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     One solution could be an app that rewards students for time spent away from their phones. Another option is converting your smartphone to a dumbphone that has none of the
     <strong>
      intoxicating
     </strong>
     distractions on it. But mainly, perhaps, we just need to look up more and reconnect with the real world!
