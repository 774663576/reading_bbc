     我们都需要朋友，但友谊是一成不变的吗？生活的变迁意味着我们的朋友圈也会发生变化。哪些人是泛泛之交？哪些人才是推心置腹的挚友？本期 “随身英语” 讨论友谊这个话题。

     <strong>
      词汇：friendship 友谊
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Who do you count as your friends? From our
     <strong>
      BFF
     </strong>
     to a
     <strong>
      work mate
     </strong>
     , it’s good to have someone to
     <strong>
      chew the fat
     </strong>
     with or offer
     <strong>
      comfort
     </strong>
     and support. But when it comes to
     <strong>
      friendship
     </strong>
     , is it more important to have quantity or quality?
    </p>
    <p>
     The recent isolation we have endured due to the coronavirus pandemic has made some of us question our friendships. We’ve fallen
     <strong>
      out of touch
     </strong>
     with friends and
     <strong>
      acquaintances
     </strong>
     , and it may feel awkward, but do we actually have to
     <strong>
      rekindle
     </strong>
     every
     <strong>
      relationship
     </strong>
     we once had? It might be time to
     <strong>
      take stock
     </strong>
     and think about who you kept in touch with, who you missed talking to, and who you didn’t. In short, maybe it’s time to reset your list of real
     <strong>
      mates
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s no obligation to stay friends, and writing for BBC Worklife, Bryan Lufkin says: “While people have known for years that friendships are unquestionably good for your health, experts say it’s only natural for acquaintances and even friends to
     <strong>
      fall by the wayside
     </strong>
     as time goes on – and it’s nothing to feel guilty about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, it can be hard to choose who’s in your
     <strong>
      friendship circle
     </strong>
     . This is what Suzanne Degges-White, professor of counselling at Northern Illinois University, calls our ‘
     <strong>
      friendscape
     </strong>
     ’. She says, “in life, as we go through certain stages and ages, our attention shifts, and we want to be around people who are like us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     So, changing friends is normal, but we still need those special
     <strong>
      pals
     </strong>
     who’ve known us long term. These are friendships we invest time in. According to Robin Dunbar, a professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Oxford, these are your
     <strong>
      inner circle
     </strong>
     of friends – your “
     <strong>
      shoulders to cry on
     </strong>
     ” – and you have to see them at least once a week to keep them in that circle. He adds that the friends that do
     <strong>
      drift
     </strong>
     are mostly “
     <strong>
      friendships of
     </strong>
     <strong>
      convenience
     </strong>
     ”. But the advice for maintaining a good friendship is to share how you feel with someone you trust – this can help
     <strong>
      strengthen
     </strong>
     your friendship as well as giving you both a chance to support each other.
