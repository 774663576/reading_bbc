     <strong>
      Fungi
     </strong>
     play an important role in
     <strong>
      ecosystems
     </strong>
     , are a
     <strong>
      source of
     </strong>
     food, and
     <strong>
      make
     </strong>
     key
     <strong>
      contributions
     </strong>
     to the world of medicine. So, why do we know so little about them?
    </p>
    <p>
     An estimated two million
     <strong>
      fungal species
     </strong>
     – more than 90% of all fungi – have yet to be described by science, according to Rebecca Morelle, science reporter for the BBC. In the UK alone, there are thought to be around 25,000 species of fungi – five or six times more than plants. Scientists are trying to find out more about this largely
     <strong>
      unexplored
     </strong>
     world, but it is challenging. Dr Martyn Ainsworth, a senior researcher from Royal
     <strong>
      Botanic
     </strong>
     Gardens, Kew, in London, says: 'We can grow a certain number in the
     <strong>
      lab
     </strong>
     , but there is
     <strong>
      a whole host of
     </strong>
     fungi that we cannot grow in the lab. This has held back a lot of research.'
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact that we know so little about the world of fungi leads many of us to misunderstand them. 'A lot of people are afraid of
     <strong>
      poisonous
     </strong>
     mushrooms', says Dr Jassy Drakulic, a plant pathologist, 'but only a very small
     <strong>
      proportion
     </strong>
     of the thousands of species of fungi in the world can cause
     <strong>
      disease
     </strong>
     '. Most are harmless and often beneficial, called by some 'the hidden helpers of our environment'. Some fungi provide food and
     <strong>
      shelter
     </strong>
     for
     <strong>
      wildlife
     </strong>
     , help plants
     <strong>
      absorb
     </strong>
     water and
     <strong>
      nutrients
     </strong>
     and recycle
     <strong>
      waste
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      dead matter
     </strong>
     . Other types of fungi grow on the
     <strong>
      roots
     </strong>
     of trees and plants, forming a huge underground network that helps
     <strong>
      nourish
     </strong>
     trees. 'Fungi are really the behind-the-scenes team that are doing all the work', adds Dr Ainsworth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, next time you add mushrooms to your dinner, take a painkiller for a headache, or go for a walk through the woods, remember to thank the living things that made it all possible – fungi.

     1. True or False?
     <em>
      There are more species of fungi than species of plants in the UK.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      True. In the UK, there are thought to be around five or six times more species of fungi than plants.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. What's one reason why research into fungi has been held back?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      According to Dr Martyn Ainsworth, many fungi can't be grown in a lab, so it's harder to study them.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. What proportion of fungi are poisonous?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      According to Dr Jassy Drakulic, only a very small proportion of the thousands of species of fungi in the world can cause disease.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Are the ways in which fungi benefit the environment obvious?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      No. Fungi are referred to as 'the hidden helpers of our environment' and as 'the behind-the-scenes team that are doing all the work'.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. True or False?
     <em>
      Fungi only provide food for animals.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      False. Fungi provide food for wildlife, but they also form a huge underground network that helps nourish trees.
