     In July 2024, a
     <strong>
      pod
     </strong>
     of 77
     <strong>
      pilot
     </strong>
     <strong>
      whales
     </strong>
     <strong>
      washed up
     </strong>
     on a beach in Orkney, Scotland. It was the largest
     <strong>
      mass
     </strong>
     <strong>
      stranding
     </strong>
     of whales in Scotland for decades. Scientists don't know exactly why whales
     <strong>
      beach
     </strong>
     themselves. One theory is that climate change is driving whales' food closer to the
     <strong>
      shoreline
     </strong>
     , where they then get stuck as the
     <strong>
      tide
     </strong>
     goes out. If a single animal is found, it is usually because it is sick or has been injured.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Orkney stranding, 12 of the whales were still alive when they became beached. When this happens,
     <strong>
      marine
     </strong>
     organisations assess whether a whale can be safely
     <strong>
      refloated
     </strong>
     . Professionals and members of the community often come together, cover the animal in wet sheets and pour buckets of water over it, though not the
     <strong>
      blowhole
     </strong>
     , until the animal
     <strong>
      drifts
     </strong>
     back
     <strong>
      out
     </strong>
     to the ocean. Though it's not always a happy ending.
    </p>
    <p>
     For those that don't survive, a
     <strong>
      post-mortem examination
     </strong>
     is often carried out. Dr Brownlow of the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme told the BBC that these can reveal a lot about the whale's life and the reasons why it was beached. In 2024, a very rare species of whale turned up on a beach in New Zealand – a
     <strong>
      spade-toothed whale
     </strong>
     . While this is sad, the
     <strong>
      carcass
     </strong>
     was
     <strong>
      dissected
     </strong>
     in order to help researchers acquire new information about the species. "From a scientific and
     <strong>
      conservation
     </strong>
     point of view, this is huge", Gabe Davies, a Department of Conservation official, said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some beached whales who don't survive have their
     <strong>
      skeletons
     </strong>
     sent to museums, while many others are returned to the water. This ensures the marine environment benefits because whale carcasses give off many nutrients. "When they fall and die and sink to the bottom of the ocean, they form these little
     <strong>
      nutrient
     </strong>
     -
     <strong>
      rich
     </strong>
     islands that can support a huge
     <strong>
      diversity
     </strong>
     of life", says Dr Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
     The more research that can be done, the better. For now, we can only do what we can to keep our oceans clean and safe.

    <p>
     4. What happened to the spade-toothed whale carcass?
