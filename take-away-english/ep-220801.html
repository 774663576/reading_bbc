     With our already busy lives, finding time to exercise can feel like one more thing on our ‘to do’ list. So maybe it would help if there was ‘a best time’ to exercise? Could exercising at certain times help maximise our
     <strong>
      fitness goals
     </strong>
     ? The answer is ‘yes’, but it’s easier than you think – no matter who you are, or when you like to
     <strong>
      work
     </strong>
     <strong>
      out
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="Normal1">
     There are clear
     <strong>
      benefits
     </strong>
     to exercising in the morning. Many of us have more free time compared to later in the day, and it may therefore be easier for us to
     <strong>
      stick to
     </strong>
     a morning
     <strong>
      workout
     </strong>
     routine. A study published in Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise found that
     <strong>
      participants
     </strong>
     who exercised in the morning,
     <strong>
      increased
     </strong>
     their
     <strong>
      physical activity
     </strong>
     <strong>
      throughout
     </strong>
     <strong>
      the day
     </strong>
     , were less
     <strong>
      distracted
     </strong>
     by food, and slept better. Exercising on an empty stomach before breakfast could also
     <strong>
      burn
     </strong>
     more
     <strong>
      fat
     </strong>
     and increase
     <strong>
      metabolism
     </strong>
     , which means you’ll continue to burn calories throughout the day.
    </p>
    <p class="Normal1">
     So, good news for early birds, but what if you’re not a morning person? Working out in the afternoon or evening also has benefits, just different ones. For example, your body’s ability to perform
     <strong>
      peaks
     </strong>
     in the afternoon, according to a 2010 study by the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports. Also, in the afternoon and evening, your
     <strong>
      reaction time
     </strong>
     is quickest, and your
     <strong>
      heart rate
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      blood pressure
     </strong>
     are lowest, which
     <strong>
      reduce
     </strong>
     your chance of
     <strong>
      injury
     </strong>
     while improving
     <strong>
      performance
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p class="Normal1">
     But does any of this change depending on whether you’re a man or a woman? Our bodies are different, after all, so the best time to exercise may be different too. A 2022 study from Skidmore College, New York, looked at exactly this question and the results showed that there are some differences. Want to reduce your blood pressure and you’re a woman? Exercise in the morning. Want to improve your heart health and you’re a man? Evening is better for you. But, ultimately, the study found that there are clear benefits for both sexes to exercising at either time of day.
    </p>
    <p class="Normal1">
     So what time is best? It seems the answer is: whatever time is best for you!
