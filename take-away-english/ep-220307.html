     We’ve all been there. One minute you’re searching for something serious, like a recipe for dinner, or something for work, and the next you’ve been
     <strong>
      sucked in
     </strong>
     by endless videos of cats doing funny things after seeing a catchy title in your suggested videos column. They’re
     <strong>
      compelling
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      engrossing
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      captivating
     </strong>
     , and you can end up spending hours watching kittens make funny noises or mistiming jumps. But why do these videos so often end up going
     <strong>
      viral
     </strong>
     ? What makes them so
     <strong>
      enthralling
     </strong>
     ? And why are they more popular than dog videos?
    </p>
    <p>
     First, let’s talk about
     <strong>
      stereotypes
     </strong>
     . When many of us think about dogs, we imagine them rolling over onto their backs, tongues hanging out, or making a mess. They seem trusting and innocent – and they do silly things. Cats, on the other hand, seem somewhat more
     <strong>
      refined
     </strong>
     and independent. There’s a reason we have an expression ‘
     <strong>
      cool cat
     </strong>
     ’. In short, cats seem more serious – and
     <strong>
      savvy
     </strong>
     . If we can
     <strong>
      get one over on
     </strong>
     a cat and make them do something like get in a box that slides down a hill, it’s comical. But with a dog, it’s not as funny because they trust you – and it’s easier.
     <strong>
      Tricking
     </strong>
     a cat, due to their
     <strong>
      wiliness
     </strong>
     , has more payoff.
    </p>
    <p>
     The internet is filled with videos of cats making funny faces or reacting strangely. But why are they so funny? Well, simply – it’s
     <strong>
      unexpected
     </strong>
     . If you saw a cat walking down the street coolly or observing and preparing to attack a mouse, it wouldn’t be funny. But if that cat was walking sideways, wearing a silly costume, or becoming best friends with the mouse, suddenly we might start to laugh. Watching a cat that is normally
     <strong>
      majestic
     </strong>
     walk
     <strong>
      clunkily
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      pull a
     </strong>
     bizarre
     <strong>
      face
     </strong>
     is hilarious because it’s not something we would normally associate with that animal. It’s like watching someone who is normally very serious get
     <strong>
      the
     </strong>
     <strong>
      giggles
     </strong>
     . In some ways, we’re all laughing at their
     <strong>
      fall from grace
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So the next time you see one of those many
     <strong>
      memes
     </strong>
     of cats in awkward situations or videos that make you chuckle, try to remember why it’s so funny. And spare a thought for all those dogs that are trying to entertain us too.

     1. What might we have been doing before we started watching cat videos?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      We might have been doing something serious like looking for recipes or something for work.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. What do many of us think are the characteristics of dogs?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Many of us think dogs are innocent, trusting and silly.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. What do many of us think are the characteristics of cats?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Many of us think cats are independent, smart and untrusting.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Why is it not as funny to trick a dog compared with a cat?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because dogs are trusting, it’s easy to trick them. Cats on the other hand don’t seem as trusting – so when you trick them, there’s more payoff.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. Why is it funny to watch a cat pull a funny face?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Because it is unexpected and out of character.
