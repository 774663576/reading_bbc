     你最不喜欢一周中的哪一天？哪一天最难熬？ 很多人的回答可能都是 “星期一”。一周的开始意味着快乐的周末已经结束，新一周的工作学习也已经展开。本文围绕 “什么让星期一变得郁闷” 以及这种感觉是否只存在于我们的脑海里展开讨论。

     Ask most people which day of the week they
     <strong>
      dread
     </strong>
     the most and the answer is likely to be Monday. The first day of the week can make us
     <strong>
      grouchy
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      depressed
     </strong>
     , which is why the feeling is described as the
     <strong>
      Monday blues
     </strong>
     . But what is it exactly that makes us feel
     <strong>
      down
     </strong>
     and does it affect everyone?
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently, the most depressing day of the year is the third Monday in January, when it’s cold and dark outside. This day was nicknamed ‘
     <strong>
      Blue Monday
     </strong>
     ’ by
     <strong>
      psychologist
     </strong>
     Cliff Arnall in 2004. He came up with it after a holiday company asked him for a ‘scientific formula’ for the January blues.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if there was little science behind the formula, it’s probably true that the sound of our alarm clock on any Monday morning signals the dawning of a new week and possibly the end of our weekend of fun. Research shows our Monday
     <strong>
      mood
     </strong>
     can be based on a direct comparison to the day before. It’s what psychologists call
     <strong>
      an emotional shift
     </strong>
     , and no other part of the week has a transition like it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Monday means the end of weekend lie-ins – it’s back to the routine and the
     <strong>
      realisation
     </strong>
     that there are five days ahead of the nine-to-five, and according to the BBC Bitesize website “If you can’t stand your job then the Monday blues can be very real.” And your
     <strong>
      miserable
     </strong>
     Monday is followed by
     <strong>
      trying
     </strong>
     Tuesday – the most popular day for sending out job applications.
    </p>
    <p>
     But is Monday as bad as we like to think it is? Feeling a bit
     <strong>
      low
     </strong>
     shouldn’t be confused with more serious
     <strong>
      depression
     </strong>
     , caused by other factors. Writing for the BBC, author and presenter Claudia Hammond, argues that this low feeling might be a myth. She says: “There is a strong cultural idea that we don’t like Mondays.” She mentions an Australian study in 2008 about how people
     <strong>
      reflected
     </strong>
     on their mood and found the day that scored the lowest was in fact Wednesdays. So, when Monday comes, maybe we should give it a second chance!
