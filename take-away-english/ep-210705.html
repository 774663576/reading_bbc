     Procrastination is often seen as the enemy of
     <strong>
      productivity
     </strong>
     . Images of lazy people with
     <strong>
      feet up
     </strong>
     on desks or wasting time to
     <strong>
      dodge
     </strong>
     work spring to mind at the very mention of the word. And there are many things which indicate that procrastination is a problem which needs
     <strong>
      addressing
     </strong>
     . But could there be some benefits to it too?
    </p>
    <p>
     We live in a
     <strong>
      high-octane
     </strong>
     world – always
     <strong>
      on the go
     </strong>
     , racing from one task to another. And at times,
     <strong>
      duties
     </strong>
     , be it work or personal, can feel
     <strong>
      relentless
     </strong>
     – with our
     <strong>
      nose
     </strong>
     constantly
     <strong>
      to the grindstone
     </strong>
     . Sometimes we just need to
     <strong>
      switch off
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      chill out
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      reboot
     </strong>
     . A little procrastination can help detach us from the pressures of modern life. According to psychotherapist F Diane Barth, watching TV, taking a long bath or listening to music can help us to
     <strong>
      ease off
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     And it’s possible that procrastination has become more prevalent during the pandemic. With many countries going through lockdowns, some of us have suddenly found ourselves with more time – not having the hours of commutes, or options of social activities we once
     <strong>
      took for granted
     </strong>
     . Being at home, many of us quickly discovered that it is impossible to be productive 24-7. That extra relaxation can help us to be more productive or creative
     <strong>
      in the long run
     </strong>
     , allowing us to clear our minds and focus better.
    </p>
    <p>
     The issue is that many of us see that time not working as lost time. And we almost develop a sense of guilt related to not
     <strong>
      making the most
     </strong>
     <strong>
      of
     </strong>
     every moment. German sociologist and economist Max Weber says that we’ve almost got to the point of believing that the busier we are, the better, and that there is a sense of morality connected with time usage. It seems important to remember that taking a little time away from yourself is not just
     <strong>
      slacking off
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, while being productive is important, it seems that some amount of
     <strong>
      downtime
     </strong>
     and procrastination can help us to relax and become more focussed. The next time you feel really stressed, why not try wasting a little time? You might just like it.
