     <span>
      What is it about reunions that make some people
      <strong>
       reluctant
      </strong>
      to go to? Is it that they're afraid of being judged by people who they met in their
      <strong>
       heyday
      </strong>
      ? Is it a fear of having betrayed
      <strong>
       high expectations
      </strong>
      ? Or is it the risk of realising that the sparkle that held the group together is no longer there?
     </span>

      Fans have been keen on a Spice Girls reunion, but Posh Spice is saying 'no'. Fans have
      <strong>
       eagerly
      </strong>
      followed months of
      <strong>
       speculation
      </strong>
      about the five British singers getting together again. For this generation – now mainly middle aged mothers – it's a chance to introduce the band to their own daughters. But, unfortunately, it’s not
      <strong>
       gonna
      </strong>
      happen. They might see four of them.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The
      <strong>
       spoil sport
      </strong>
      seems to be Victoria Beckham. Maybe Posh Spice became too
      <strong>
       posh
      </strong>
      herself to
      <strong>
       shake her booty
      </strong>
      on a stage. She's said in the past that she’s got no plans to join with Baby, Scary, Ginger and Sporty.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      "Doing the Olympics was an incredible honour. That's great. Thank you to everybody, but no more," she said after the group performed at the closing ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      And then there's Friends. Well, no more chats at the (
      <strong>
       fictitious
      </strong>
      ) Central Perk cafe for Chandler Bing. Actor Matthew Perry has announced that he won't
      <strong>
       attend
      </strong>
      the reunion show of the hit American TV sitcom which
      <strong>
       captured the imagination
      </strong>
      of audiences in several countries. It ended in 2004 after ten series.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     Perry's spokesperson said he "may
     <strong>
      tape
     </strong>
     something" as a
     <strong>
      tribute
     </strong>
     to the series' creator James Burrows but… he is
     <strong>
      otherwise engaged
     </strong>
     . As some Hollywood actors do, he will star in a play in London which runs until May. It's a story about being middle aged. Enough said.

      </em>
      .
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <strong>
       False. The reunion of the five members of the pop group was surrounded by speculation so nobody could be sure it was going to happen.

     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      2.  What are Baby, Scary, Ginger and Sporty?
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>

      3.  What is the Central Perk?
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <strong>
       The Central Perk is the name of a factitious cafe where the main characters of the American sitcom Friends used to get together to chat and… drink coffee.
      </strong>
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      4. What might the actor who played Chandler Bing do instead of joining the other members of the cast?
      <br/>
     </span>
     <strong>
      <span>
       According to his spokesperson, he might record a message paying tribute to the creator of the popular show Friends.
      </span>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      5. What does the author of the article mean by 'enough said'?
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      <strong>
       The author implies that being older and having other interests might be a reason for some people not to be keen on going to reunions and this might be the case regarding Matthew Perry.
