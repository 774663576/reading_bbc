     Exam day - what do you do? I take a ring my grandfather gave me to the exam. It's a reminder of his affection and gives me a sense of security and
     <strong>
      calms my nerves
     </strong>
     . My brother
     <strong>
      makes a fuss
     </strong>
     about wearing his green underwear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     He's not alone in placing his hopes in a garment. One in three students admitted to wearing 'good luck underwear' to try to
     <strong>
      boost
     </strong>
     exam chances, according to a poll for pen makers, Bic.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The same poll suggested that 60% of students change their diet before a test in the hope that it can increase their
     <strong>
      brain power
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      memory
     </strong>
     – oily fish and fruit and vegetables are at the top of the list. This is good as long as you don't
     <strong>
      stuff your face
     </strong>
     with junk food all year long and decide to go healthy just for the exam.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Making the extra effort to succeed is good but if you haven't put in the hours of study, nothing will help you. Patrick Wilson, former teacher and founder of a private tuition firm, says: "The best way to feel truly confident and help beat that
     <strong>
      stomach-churning
     </strong>
     exam
     <strong>
      angst
     </strong>
     is to prepare for each exam in advance, making sure you have a dedicated structure for your
     <strong>
      revision
     </strong>
     schedule."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wilson helped to create a guide for avoiding the last-minute
     <strong>
      jitters
     </strong>
     . It advises the revision timetable to start up to ten weeks before the exam, dividing learning into chunks. Don't
     <strong>
      overload
     </strong>
     yourself. Students should also give themselves regular
     <strong>
      rewards
     </strong>
     and breaks during revision. People learn things in different ways and this should be taken into account. I learn better by reading things out loud. Some colleagues believe
     <strong>
      colour-coordinating
     </strong>
     notes according to subject can produce good results too.
    </p>
    <p>
     But there's a
     <strong>
      consensus
     </strong>
     against spending the night before the exam studying. If you don't get enough sleep, not even good luck underwear will help you pass the test.
