     近来，“citywalk（城市漫步）” 成为了一种广受人们欢迎的休闲方式。不论你身处城市还是乡间，出门散步都是一种有益于放松身心的活动。但散步作为一种消遣方式起初并没有被世界各地的人们所接受。本文介绍散步的起源以及它如何演变成为现代人的一项重要日常活动。

     <strong>
      Going for a walk
     </strong>
     ' is a popular
     <strong>
      pastime
     </strong>
     among older and younger generations alike because of its well-known benefits for our physical and mental health. But you may be surprised to hear that
     <strong>
      meandering
     </strong>
     through pretty streets or
     <strong>
      hiking
     </strong>
     along mountainous ridges have not always been considered
     <strong>
      leisure activities
     </strong>
     , according to Daniel Gale, a researcher of
     <strong>
      pedestrianism
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     He says that in Britain, walking for fun "wasn't really a thing" until the 1780s. Before that, it was just something people did out of necessity, and some people associated it with criminal activity. But for Charles Dickens, the famous English 19th Century author,
     <strong>
      marching
     </strong>
     through London streets and
     <strong>
      tramping
     </strong>
     around the countryside was a big part of the creative process; a time to absorb what was going on around him. He walked at an impressive
     <strong>
      pace
     </strong>
     of four miles per hour, according to his biography by Peter Ackroyd.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if
     <strong>
      speed-walking
     </strong>
     isn't your thing, perhaps you can take inspiration from another big-thinking
     <strong>
      wanderer
     </strong>
     . 19th Century American writer Henry David Thoreau took a slower approach, preferring to
     <strong>
      saunter
     </strong>
     over hills and fields and meander through the woods. He said that he could not preserve his health and spirits, unless he spent four hours a day walking at least.
    </p>
    <p>
     This idea of taking a
     <strong>
      stroll
     </strong>
     to clear your head has survived through to the 21st Century, but has
     <strong>
      pedestrian
     </strong>
     <strong>
      etiquette
     </strong>
     remained the same? A 1780 article for the London Magazine advised pedestrians to avoid things such as
     <strong>
      loitering
     </strong>
     in conversation and obstructing people behind you with a "sauntering
     <strong>
      gait
     </strong>
     ". Nowadays, we could probably add distracted phone-users to that list.
    </p>
    <p>
     In this modern age, when many of us are tied to our desks and to our screens, the simple act of
     <strong>
      stepping
     </strong>
     <strong>
      out
     </strong>
     onto the city
     <strong>
      pavements
     </strong>
     , or getting lost in nature, may make all the difference to our wellbeing. Whether you see yourself more as a casual
     <strong>
      stroller
     </strong>
     or a purposeful
     <strong>
      strider
     </strong>
     , why not build a habit out of it?
