     The average worldwide commute is around 40 minutes. But UK workers are travelling 54 minutes and Londoners commute approximately 80 minutes by car and over two hours by train every day, according to the UK Department of Transport. Drawing on all that travelling experience, what can these commuters teach us about how best to behave during all that time spent in cars, trains, and buses?
    </p>
    <p>
     First of all, travel
     <strong>
      etiquette
     </strong>
     is important. A recent BBC article asked its readers to describe which of their fellow commuters' actions constituted
     <strong>
      bad manners
     </strong>
     . Top answers included taking too loudly, eating stinky food and putting feet up on the seats. Several respondents even mentioned a fellow train passenger
     <strong>
      clipping
     </strong>
     their
     <strong>
      toenails
     </strong>
     in the carriage. Their reactions on this
     <strong>
      boorish
     </strong>
     behaviour included feeling
     <strong>
      disgusted
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      perplexed
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      appalled
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A more controversial activity is doing make-up. Opinions varied on whether this was
     <strong>
      impolite
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      inconsiderate
     </strong>
     . One reader said he was so offended by this
     <strong>
      conduct
     </strong>
     , he had to change carriages. However, the idea that make-up should be applied in private is an outdated concept, says professional make-up artist Nic Chapman and one half of beauty brand, Pixiwoo. "We are not
     <strong>
      ashamed
     </strong>
     of wearing make-up," she told the BBC. Dilruba Khanom told the BBC "I do admire a woman's confidence to
     <strong>
      not give two hoots
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      slap on the face
     </strong>
     ."
    </p>
    <p>
     But a long commute isn't just about negative experiences. Many UK commuters turned to innovative activities to better make use of their time on transport. 37-year-old Ben Yallop, who manages international judicial relations at the Royal Courts of Justice, used his daily three-hour trip to write and
     <strong>
      self-publish
     </strong>
     two novels. He started "
     <strong>
      jotting down ideas
     </strong>
     " for a series of them. "I've done almost all my research, plotting and writing on the train," he tells the BBC. Alternatively, 24-year-old Amy Dickett uses her 90-minute trip to photograph fellow commuters for her Commute
     <strong>
      Blog
     </strong>
     . She
     <strong>
      snaps a picture
     </strong>
     and asks them to tell her something surprising about themselves. "Usually they are surprised but glad to have some entertainment on an otherwise boring journey. Often the people around us join in and will ask their own questions," she told the BBC.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, no matter where or how long your journey is, take a leaf from the UK commuter's book. Don't
     <strong>
      antagonise
     </strong>
     your fellow passengers and rather than staring into space – use your time creatively.
