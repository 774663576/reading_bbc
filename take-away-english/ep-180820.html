     今夏，整个欧洲格外炎热。明媚的天气虽然人人爱，但夏日炽热的阳光确实也给人们的生活带来了各种各样的挑战。在长达数月的酷暑期间，有哪些保持清凉的好方法呢？本集《随身英语》来支招！

    <p>
     This summer, the UK, and much of the northern hemisphere, has experienced a
     <strong>
      heatwave
     </strong>
     – a sustained period of
     <strong>
      roasting
     </strong>
     temperatures and
     <strong>
      scorching
     </strong>
     sunshine. While many welcome the Sun and warmth, too much can be dangerous to health. So what are the best ways to keep
     <strong>
      cool
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, avoiding
     <strong>
      exposure
     </strong>
     is a good idea, says the UK Met office. This means not going out in
     <strong>
      direct sunlight
     </strong>
     , or, where possible, sticking to
     <strong>
      shadows
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      shade
     </strong>
     . This also means that
     <strong>
      covering up
     </strong>
     is a good idea. Wear loose,
     <strong>
      airy
     </strong>
     clothing, which fully covers the body, as well as a hat and sunglasses. In addition, a
     <strong>
      parasol
     </strong>
     could provide valuable protection. Finally, the UK's National Health Service recommends not going out between 11 in the morning and three in the afternoon if you are vulnerable to the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Staying
     <strong>
      hydrated
     </strong>
     is another excellent idea. The human body is approximately 60% water, which on a hot day, can be depleted through
     <strong>
      sweat
     </strong>
     . If this water is not replenished,
     <strong>
      dehydration
     </strong>
     can occur. The US Geological Survey's water science school recommends drinking three litres a day for an adult male, and 2.3 litres for an adult female, though this varies according to circumstance. You should also avoid alcohol, which
     <strong>
      dehydrates
     </strong>
     the body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether at home or at work, steps should be taken to reduce temperatures indoors, too.
     <strong>
      Blinds
     </strong>
     , curtains and
     <strong>
      shades
     </strong>
     should be closed and windows opened to allow the building to
     <strong>
      ventilate
     </strong>
     . This is especially important at night while you sleep. The UK Met office says "night cooling is important as it allows the body to recuperate."
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, for those working outside, extra precautions should be taken. In addition to staying covered and drinking water,
     <strong>
      high-factor
     </strong>
     <strong>
      sunscreen
     </strong>
     should be worn to stop sunburn and the possible development of skin cancer. In addition, those who perform physical tasks in the Sun should be careful of
     <strong>
      heatstroke
     </strong>
     , which, according to the UK Met Office, can be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
     For many, summer is a well-loved period of warmth and outdoor activity, but as the old saying goes, everything in moderation. That said, as long as people remember the basics and look after themselves, there is no reason why a prolonged heatwave can't become the summer that everyone remembers.
