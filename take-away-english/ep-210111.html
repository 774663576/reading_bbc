     你经常迟到吗？你的迟到会让周围的人感到恼火吗？也许迟到不是你的错！本文讨论人们守时或迟到的原因。

     <strong>
      词汇：punctuality 守时
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     As the saying goes, ‘
     <strong>
      time waits for no man
     </strong>
     ’. Time is always against us, and we just can’t stop it. Maybe that’s why some of us are always
     <strong>
      running late
     </strong>
     for appointments. But if
     <strong>
      timekeeping
     </strong>
     is not what you’re good at, don’t stress. There might be a good reason for your lack of punctuality.
    </p>
    <p>
     People’s attitudes to
     <strong>
      being on time
     </strong>
     vary. Some
     <strong>
      clock-watch
     </strong>
     and make sure they’re
     <strong>
      bang on time
     </strong>
     for a meeting. It is, after all, rude to be late, and if you can make it on time, why can’t everyone else? But if, like me, you want to
     <strong>
      make every second count
     </strong>
     , you might try to squeeze as much as you can into the time you have available. However, when your
     <strong>
      schedule
     </strong>
     doesn’t run to plan, your punctuality inevitably slips.
    </p>
    <p>
     People who lack
     <strong>
      promptness
     </strong>
     have been described as ‘
     <strong>
      time benders
     </strong>
     ’. Author Grace Pacie told the BBC that “they’re the people who don’t want to be late, but they have a strange resistance to being early, and they don’t allow enough time.” They assume their journey to an appointment will always go smoothly, and the train will always be on time!
    </p>
    <p>
     Perceptions of
     <strong>
      unpunctual
     </strong>
     people are almost always negative – even if sometimes wrong. Writing for the BBC, Laura Clarke says: “Being consistently late might not be your fault. It could be your type. The
     <strong>
      punctually-challenged
     </strong>
     often share personality characteristics, such as optimism, low levels of self-control, anxiety, or a
     <strong>
      penchant
     </strong>
     for thrill-seeking, experts say. It is also possible people are late so not to be
     <strong>
      conspicuous
     </strong>
     and to avoid the anxious wait for others to turn up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe us
     <strong>
      latecomers
     </strong>
     should make more of an effort and follow the advice I heard to not ‘try’ to be on time but ‘decide’ to be on time. But I know if a meeting or a
     <strong>
      deadline
     </strong>
     really matters, then I’ll be there. Otherwise relax, even if others are cursing you!
