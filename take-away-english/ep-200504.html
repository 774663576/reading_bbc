     现在，人工智能可以帮助我们消除一些枯燥的、重复性的工作。机器人技术的进步与发展着实让人惊叹，但与此同时，我们又有了新的担忧：我们会被机器人取代吗？本文介绍目前已投入工作中的机器人。

    <p>
     If you’re in a job performing tedious tasks, you might think that a
     <strong>
      robot
     </strong>
     could do the work instead. But perhaps we underestimate how much technology already helps with the activities that we would otherwise have to do.  And as
     <strong>
      artificial intelligence
     </strong>
     progresses we might find it replaces us in the workplace altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
     For now,
     <strong>
      robotic
     </strong>
     technology is providing
     <strong>
      a helping hand
     </strong>
     for businesses, particularly in manufacturing, assisting humans in performing work more
     <strong>
      efficiently
     </strong>
     and sometimes more
     <strong>
      accurately
     </strong>
     . For online shopping, for example, robots have become
     <strong>
      essential
     </strong>
     in giant warehouses. They
     <strong>
      sort
     </strong>
     and move millions of objects of all different shapes and sizes, although humans are still needed to pick and
     <strong>
      distribute
     </strong>
     the goods.
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <strong>
      advancement
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      robotics
     </strong>
     in the workplace is good for some businesses; the ones who
     <strong>
      research
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      develop
     </strong>
     , build and use them. The British government estimates that by 2035, artificial intelligence could add around £630bn to the UK economy. But there are still tasks that robots can’t yet do, and that’s the challenge for companies such as Automata. Its co-founder, Suryansh Chandra, told the BBC that his technology will
     <strong>
      eliminate
     </strong>
     boring,
     <strong>
      repetitive
     </strong>
     jobs that humans don't like and aren't very good at, and also create new ones that are likely to replace them.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems
     <strong>
      inevitable
     </strong>
     that robots will eventually be able to do more and more of the jobs that are currently performed by humans, so should we be worried by the rise of the machines? Some experts fear hundreds of thousands of jobs could disappear as robots replace human workers. A report by the OECD suggests that 14% of jobs are "at high risk of
     <strong>
      automation
     </strong>
     " and 32% of jobs could be "radically
     <strong>
      transformed
     </strong>
     ", with the manufacturing sector at the highest risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as complete automation is some way off, for now we’ll have to work side-by-side with our robot
     <strong>
      colleagues
     </strong>
     - and manage to get along with them before they learn to kick us out of the door!
