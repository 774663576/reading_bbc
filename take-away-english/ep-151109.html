     Go home and shut all the windows because Abigail is coming! In this case, Abigail is not a very angry lady, but the name of a
     <strong>
      storm
     </strong>
     chosen by the public in an initiative by the UK
     <strong>
      weather service
     </strong>
     , the Met Office, and its Irish counterpart Met Eireann.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the last few months they have
     <strong>
      compiled
     </strong>
     a list of names suggested by ordinary people. In
     <strong>
      alphabetical order
     </strong>
     , Barney is next, followed by Clodagh. You might find Katie down the line, and also Nigel.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The idea of giving peoples' names to storms is to make people more aware that bad weather is on its way – and it is more understandable than giving them the
     <strong>
      latitude
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      longitude
     </strong>
     . Following a
     <strong>
      convention
     </strong>
     by the US, no storms will be given names beginning with the less common letters: Q, U, X, Y and Z.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The National
     <strong>
      Hurricane
     </strong>
     Center in Miami has officially been naming the Atlantic's
     <strong>
      tropical cyclones
     </strong>
     since 1953 – men's names were included in the 1970s. But the list is maintained and updated by the World
     <strong>
      Meteorological
     </strong>
     Organization, a UN agency based in Geneva.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Names of storms considered too
     <strong>
      catastrophic
     </strong>
     are 'retired' and replaced. No more Katrina – the name of the devastating hurricane that killed nearly 2,000 in the US in 2005. Cyclones are
     <strong>
      upgraded
     </strong>
     to hurricanes if they reach 119km/h.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But what happens when there are too many storms in the world in a particular year? Julian Heming, tropical predictions scientist at the Met Office in the UK, explains: "If the remainder of the
     <strong>
      season
     </strong>
     is very active, it's not out of the question we'll have to... start using letters from the Greek alphabet."

      1. 阅读课文并回答问题。
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     1. Who is Abigail?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Abigail is not a person – it's the first name chosen by the public in a list of names for storms.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     2. Why are storms given names?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      Storms are given names to make people more aware that bad weather is on its way – names are easier to remember than geographical positions.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     3. True or False?
     <em>
      The name Katie was taken off the list after a hurricane with this name caused great devastation.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <strong>
      False. The name taken off the list – or 'retired' – was Katrina.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     4. Why won't we see a hurricane called Quentin?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      No storms are given names starting with Q, U, X, Y and Z, following a convention in the US.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     5. What happens if they run out of names in any particular year?
     <br/>
     <strong>
      The meteorologists might use names starting with letters of the Greek alphabet.
