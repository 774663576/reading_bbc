    <p>
     Going to work can be a
     <strong>
      slog
     </strong>
     , especially if your job is full of tedious
     <strong>
      tasks
     </strong>
     and pointless meetings. Obviously, work is necessary to earn an
     <strong>
      income
     </strong>
     , and if you get good
     <strong>
      job satisfaction
     </strong>
     it’s a
     <strong>
      bonus
     </strong>
     ! But what can make it more worthwhile are the extra
     <strong>
      perks
     </strong>
     that your employer offers you as a reward for your
     <strong>
      loyalty
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      commitment
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Employee benefits
     </strong>
     are commonplace these days. Traditionally, these have included a good
     <strong>
      pension
     </strong>
     and extra days off work. But when a job used to be
     <strong>
      for life
     </strong>
     , there wasn’t much
     <strong>
      incentive
     </strong>
     to try and keep staff. Now millennials look to leave their jobs within the first two years, and when they are seeking a
     <strong>
      position
     </strong>
     , they want to know the benefits they’ll get on top of their pay. These include half-price cinema tickets,
     <strong>
      cycle to work schemes
     </strong>
     and gym passes.
    </p>
    <p>
     But these perks come at a cost to an employer, and now technology is being used to discover if and when they offer
     <strong>
      value for money
     </strong>
     . Writing for the BBC, Jessica Bown says “Emerging technologies such as data analytics, chatbots, and wearables can help employers know which benefits
     <strong>
      resonate with
     </strong>
     employees.” The idea is to avoid wasting money on things that don’t get used and enable a company to
     <strong>
      tailor
     </strong>
     what it can offer to attract and
     <strong>
      retain
     </strong>
     the right staff.
    </p>
    <p>
     As an example, at merchant bank, Close Brothers, AI has been used to develop chatbots that can help employees to find information on subjects ranging from mental health to saving for
     <strong>
      retirement
     </strong>
     at any time. And Microsoft has developed software to help businesses track their employee’s
     <strong>
      wellbeing
     </strong>
     needs. Anna Rasmussen, founder of Open Blend, told the BBC “It shows companies what their employees need to stay
     <strong>
      motivated
     </strong>
     and reach their
     <strong>
      full potential
     </strong>
     in real-time.” Insurance company Vitality offer wearable technology to track employees’ movements. Staff can earn ‘rewards’ by having their activity tracked. A study found that by measuring participant’s performance, they did the equivalent of 4.8 extra days of activity per month.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems that if used in the right way, technology can provide greater
     <strong>
      engagement
     </strong>
     between an employee and the company. That can lead to a happier, healthier and committed work force. But
     <strong>
      human resources
     </strong>
     experts warn against relying solely on tech for deciding on employee benefits provision. Greater understanding of new technology and how it’s used is needed, they say.
