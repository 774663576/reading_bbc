     小婴儿咿咿呀呀的哭闹声也能反映出不同地区的口音? 不同地方的婴儿的哭声之间有着惊人的差异。在本文中，我们将了解婴儿是如何开始学习语言、影响语言发展的因素有哪些、以及为什么牙牙学语是语言发展的关键状态。

     No! That's the only word we hear in the latest cute baby video to go viral. But it's not the words that baby Orla says that has made this video so popular. It's the fact that her
     <strong>
      babbling
     </strong>
     clearly
     <strong>
      mimics
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      distinctive
     </strong>
     <strong>
      Scouse
     </strong>
     accent from Liverpool.
    </p>
    <p>
     This now-famous
     <strong>
      infant
     </strong>
     may only have been born in 2022, but the different accents of babbling babies have been investigated for many years. A study from 2009 found that French babies tend to cry with a rising
     <strong>
      intonation
     </strong>
     , while German babies' cries often have a falling intonation. Other studies have shown American and French babies reflecting
     <strong>
      syllables
     </strong>
     from English and French respectively, and that babies with parents who speak a
     <strong>
      tonal
     </strong>
     language, like Mandarin, had a greater range of
     <strong>
      tones
     </strong>
     in their crying.
    </p>
    <p>
     So why does this happen? As children develop, they practise making the
     <strong>
      sounds
     </strong>
     of the language that they hear around them. It's natural that they
     <strong>
      pick up
     </strong>
     the sounds and
     <strong>
      rhythms
     </strong>
     that surround them. In fact, babies start to learn language from their mother from three months before birth. However, it's not just the language of
     <strong>
      immediate family
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      caregivers
     </strong>
     that has an impact. Professor of
     <strong>
      developmental psychology
     </strong>
     , Caroline Floccia, highlights studies suggesting that children are more likely to
     <strong>
      acquire
     </strong>
     the accent of their environment than that of a parent who has an accent that is
     <strong>
      foreign
     </strong>
     to that location.
    </p>
    <p>
     Why is this important to know? Well, what it shows us is that babies are learning language through practice, and that the more time that parents spend
     <strong>
      interacting
     </strong>
     with their children, the greater the opportunity for this there is. While babbling babies may not be able to say many words, studies estimate that they can understand many times the number of words than those that they can actually say. Giving babies
     <strong>
      exposure
     </strong>
     to a greater number of words, allows them to better build their
     <strong>
      vocabulary
     </strong>
     .
