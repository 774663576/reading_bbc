     The course of
     <strong>
      true love
     </strong>
     never did run smooth, Lysander tells us in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Wise words many, would say. In the fast-paced world of modern life, it can be difficult to meet anyone, let alone our
     <strong>
      soulmate
     </strong>
     . Fortunately, there's an app for that, though
     <strong>
      wooing
     </strong>
     a potential partner is still up to you.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Dating
     </strong>
     <strong>
      apps
     </strong>
     like Tinder, Bumble and Chappy have been around for a good few years and statistics prove their ongoing popularity. Tinder claims to get 1.6 billion
     <strong>
      swipes
     </strong>
     per day. A study conducted by globaldatinginsights.com, analysts of the online dating industry, found that
     <strong>
      lonely hearts
     </strong>
     in the UK spent 10 hours a week using them to find someone to
     <strong>
      go out with
     </strong>
     . And finally, a 2018 YouGov survey conducted on behalf of BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat found that of over 2000 16-34-year-olds, nearly half had used a dating app at some point.
    </p>
    <p>
     That said, the very same survey found that only 17% had met their current
     <strong>
      beau
     </strong>
     on an app. And 37% said that using an app was their least preferred method to find a potential
     <strong>
      mate
     </strong>
     to take out, for a
     <strong>
      fling
     </strong>
     or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     One possible reason for this comes from one respondent, 26-year-old Jordan. He believes that dating apps create issues with
     <strong>
      self-doubt
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     . "You're judged for the person you are on screen and not for the person you are," he told the BBC. As people open themselves up to more
     <strong>
      rejection
     </strong>
     , it can lead to feelings of depression, says relationship psychologist Madeleine Mason Roantree. Indeed, Jordan says he's been judged on dating apps for being "too young, too old and too fat."
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Deception
     </strong>
     can be another issue, with
     <strong>
      profiles
     </strong>
     often stretching the truth. Twenty-year-old Emma told Newsbeat about meeting a
     <strong>
      suitor
     </strong>
     whose height matched hers on their profiles, only to find he was a foot shorter in reality. Twenty-four-year-old Mikey believes dating apps are "quite
     <strong>
      Catfish
     </strong>
     -y" after meeting someone whose profile picture did not match their appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
     So does this mean that dating apps are a waste of time? It depends. Over 25% of those asked by YouGov might not agree. They were
     <strong>
      going steady
     </strong>
     or had
     <strong>
      tied the knot
     </strong>
     as a result of a dating app. A
     <strong>
      happily ever after
     </strong>
     might only be round the corner, but one way to find out is to swipe right and see.
