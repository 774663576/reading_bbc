     你能不能少吃肉、多吃蔬菜和水果来保护环境？一种叫做 “弹性素食主义” 的新概念近两年来逐渐流行起来，据说这种饮食有助于减缓地球气候变化，而且对人们的健康也有好处。本集节目讨论饮食新时尚 - 弹性素食主义。

     What kind of food do you eat? Are you conscious of the types of food you consume or do you
     <strong>
      stuff yourself
     </strong>
     silly with whatever is available? Today, we are constantly bombarded with media reports about research on the right
     <strong>
      diet
     </strong>
     to follow to help us maintain a healthy lifestyle or lose weight - but it's hard to know which one to pick and, once chosen, it's harder still to stick to it.  And now there's another choice to
     <strong>
      get our teeth into
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     A
     <strong>
      flexitarian
     </strong>
     diet involves eating
     <strong>
      plant-based
     </strong>
     foods and only occasionally eating meat and fish. You might think this is a
     <strong>
      halfway house
     </strong>
     to being a
     <strong>
      vegetarian
     </strong>
     by not completely
     <strong>
      abstaining
     </strong>
     from meat. But if vegetarianism is
     <strong>
      hard to swallow
     </strong>
     and you fancy
     <strong>
      chomping
     </strong>
     on the occasional
     <strong>
      lean
     </strong>
     steak, then this could be the choice for you.
    </p>
    <p>
     This eating style allows you to
     <strong>
      supplement
     </strong>
     some
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     that you wouldn't get in a stricter
     <strong>
      vegan
     </strong>
     diet – another trend growing in popularity. And like
     <strong>
      veganism
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      flexitarianism
     </strong>
     isn't about eating carefully to help you lose a few pounds - it's something people choose for
     <strong>
      ethical
     </strong>
     reasons, to help the planet. And a study into the global food system and how it affects the climate, has found that eating mainly plant-based foods is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all by 2050.
    </p>
    <p>
     This research found that
     <strong>
      food waste
     </strong>
     will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve to achieve this. But without a single solution, a combined approach is needed. Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford was one of the lead authors of the report. He told the BBC "We really found that a combination of measures would be needed to stay within environmental limits and those include changes towards healthier more plant-based diets."
    </p>
    <p>
     But whereas vegans think it's wrong for animals to be killed for food, flexitarians believe eating meat once in a while is acceptable. And Dr Springmann agrees - as long as we "treat it as a
     <strong>
      luxury
     </strong>
     , it’s probably OK but you shouldn’t have more than one
     <strong>
      serving
     </strong>
     of
     <strong>
      red meat
     </strong>
     , which includes beef and pork, per week." And here's another fact to
     <strong>
      digest
     </strong>
     : If we moved to this type of diet, the study found that
     <strong>
      greenhouse gas emissions
     </strong>
     from agriculture would be cut by more than half.
