     As you probably know, learning a
     <strong>
      foreign language
     </strong>
     is sometimes challenging. But it can also be fun. We spend hundreds of hours at school trying to
     <strong>
      get our tongues round
     </strong>
     different
     <strong>
      vocabulary
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      grammar
     </strong>
     in order to earn a
     <strong>
      qualification
     </strong>
     . But learning to speak a
     <strong>
      second language
     </strong>
     is more than just passing an exam – it
     <strong>
      opens doors
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     new opportunities, helps you to communicate with others and makes travelling overseas more fulfilling.
    </p>
    <p>
     It might come as a surprise that, according to research by the BBC, the number of teenagers learning foreign languages in UK secondary schools has dropped by 45% since the turn of the millennium.
     <strong>
      German
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      French
     </strong>
     have fallen the most. While these languages from two of the UK's closest trading partners have declined at GCSE level, there has been a noticeable surge in some others, such as
     <strong>
      Spanish
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      Mandarin
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Another survey of secondary schools suggests a third of students have dropped at least one language from their GCSE exam options. There are many reasons for this, including a perception by some students that languages are difficult.
     <strong>
      Getting to grips
     </strong>
     <strong>
      with
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      lingo
     </strong>
     of another country can certainly be a challenge and some pupils think 'Why bother?' when English is spoken by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Others have questioned the need for a second language when
     <strong>
      translation
     </strong>
     technology is advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director for business group the CBI, has told the BBC that "The decline in language learning in schools must be reversed, or else the UK will be less competitive globally and young people less prepared for the modern world." But even for those who are keen to study another language, the opportunity is being reduced. In Scotland, for example,
     <strong>
      foreign language subjects
     </strong>
     are being squeezed out of many secondary school timetables with some head teachers blaming pressure on the
     <strong>
      curriculum
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     However, some
     <strong>
      native English
     </strong>
     <strong>
      speakers
     </strong>
     have told the BBC about the benefits of speaking another
     <strong>
      tongue
     </strong>
     . Cassandra Scott, from Edinburgh, studied three languages in her final year at school. She is now a freelance
     <strong>
      translator
     </strong>
     in Edinburgh, and says "Learning languages at school really
     <strong>
      set the course
     </strong>
     <strong>
      for
     </strong>
     my
     <strong>
      career
     </strong>
     ."
