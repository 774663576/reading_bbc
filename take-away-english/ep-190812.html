     在一些用人单位，每年给员工定期加薪是常态。另外一些单位，会用奖金来感谢员工的辛勤工作，或奖励完成工作目标的员工。但是对于有些人来说，必须得要求加薪——如果你不要求，你就得不到。“随身英语” 讨论为什么很多英国人近来很难找到加薪的理由，以及如果你想要求加薪，应该怎么做。

     Being an
     <strong>
      employee
     </strong>
     at a company has many challenges – you want
     <strong>
      job satisfaction
     </strong>
     , a
     <strong>
      work-life balance
     </strong>
     and opportunities for
     <strong>
      promotion
     </strong>
     . But most of us want a decent
     <strong>
      financial reward
     </strong>
     . We aim to get a good salary to pay for the essential things in life plus a few luxuries. But when that’s not enough, we have to do the hardest thing in the world – ask our boss for a
     <strong>
      pay rise
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     In some companies, a regular annual pay rise is the norm – all staff get a fixed increase in their monthly
     <strong>
      pay packet
     </strong>
     . In other firms, workers might get a
     <strong>
      bonus
     </strong>
     to reward them for their efforts or for meeting a target. But for some people, a pay increase is something you have to ask for – and
     <strong>
      if you don’t ask, you don’t get
     </strong>
     !
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Wage
     </strong>
     increases have been a sensitive issue in recent years. Due to the global economic recession, businesses had to
     <strong>
      tighten their belts
     </strong>
     . Most
     <strong>
      public sector
     </strong>
     pay in the UK, for example, was frozen for two years in 2010, and after that rises were
     <strong>
      capped
     </strong>
     at 1% - below the
     <strong>
      rate of inflation
     </strong>
     . But last month the government awarded them a pay rise above the 2% inflation rate so that teachers, for example, will get a 2.75% salary boost. That's the equivalent to £1,000 extra a year for those on an average
     <strong>
      salary
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     But not everyone is happy at being given
     <strong>
      a fixed pay rise
     </strong>
     – they feel they’re worth more and that they deserve more money. It’s not something we should fear “asking for”, says Pip Jamieson, founder of the professional networking site, The Dots. She’s told the BBC “No one ever got fired for asking for a pay rise. In fact, rather the opposite - asking for more money shows ambition and shows you want to stay with the company.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s something BBC Business Reporter Jamie Robertson has been looking into. He’s found that you need to do your research and find out what kind of pay your job should be getting, perhaps by talking to your
     <strong>
      Human Resources
     </strong>
     department. You’ll need to give good reasons for wanting more money and you’ll still have to keep your increase within your
     <strong>
      pay grade
     </strong>
     . Ask for an exact sum and be prepared for some negotiation. Of course, if you can’t get more cash then there are other
     <strong>
      perks
     </strong>
     you could ask for, such as
     <strong>
      flexible working
     </strong>
     or more time off. But if that gets you nowhere and your boss won’t budge, maybe it’s time to quit and find a new job?
