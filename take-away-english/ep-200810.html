     在新冠肺炎疫情封锁期间，很多人都只能呆在家中，这样一来，运动量不足，导致体重上升。不过，有些人找到了一些能帮助我们在家拉伸肌肉和锻炼的好办法。本文讨论如何在家锻炼身体。

    <p>
     In a time when many people around the globe are in lockdown and unable to attend the gym, emphasis has been placed on home exercising. Fears of a
     <strong>
      sedentary life
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      piling on the pounds
     </strong>
     are forcing many to find novel ways to move the body and
     <strong>
      stretch
     </strong>
     their muscles. You don’t need to
     <strong>
      pump iron
     </strong>
     or have expensive equipment like rowing and cycling machines to help you stay fit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Exercising is not just important for your body, but also your mind. A study by Dr. Andrea Dunn at the Cooper Research Institute in Dallas, Texas found patients who did daily 35-minute walks per week experienced a 47% reduction in their depression levels.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Cardiovascular
     </strong>
     exercise, often simply called
     <strong>
      cardio
     </strong>
     , is designed to keep your
     <strong>
      heart rate
     </strong>
     up, which in turn will strengthen your heart and improve your
     <strong>
      general fitness
     </strong>
     . Many of us are turning to activities like
     <strong>
      skipping
     </strong>
     with an old rope, or watching one of the many ‘fitness experts’ who produce exercise videos online.
    </p>
    <p>
     Walking is another great
     <strong>
      aerobic
     </strong>
     activity to help you increase your
     <strong>
      blood circulation
     </strong>
     . There are many affordable
     <strong>
      pedometers
     </strong>
     which can be worn like a watch and used to track your steps, heart rate,
     <strong>
      sleeping patterns
     </strong>
     and even your
     <strong>
      blood oxygenation
     </strong>
     levels. You don’t even have to step outside, with many simply
     <strong>
      power walking
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      jogging
     </strong>
     round there gardens or up and down their hallways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Practising yoga or Tai Chi can help to keep our bodies
     <strong>
      supple
     </strong>
     , which in turn can lower
     <strong>
      joint pain
     </strong>
     and help to protect us from injury. Finally, strength and
     <strong>
      resistance training
     </strong>
     can be done at home by simply lifting bags of rice or boxes instead of heavy weights in the gym.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many ways to help us stay mobile, and indeed these online exercise routines can be carried over in our lives long after lockdown is lifted. For those of us who moan about our busy lives stopping us from
     <strong>
      hitting the gym
     </strong>
     , ten minutes a day with a rope or a bag of rice may not only help our fitness, but our mental health too.
