     We all hear about foreign actors
     <strong>
      making it big
     </strong>
     in Hollywood. But many acknowledge that they were
     <strong>
      shaking in their boots
     </strong>
     the first time they were waiting for the
     <strong>
      director
     </strong>
     to shout: '
     <strong>
      Action
     </strong>
     !'
    </p>
    <p>
     Spanish actress Penelope Cruz, star of Zoolander-2 and Vanilla Sky, is a respected actress with a Hollywood career. But she hardly spoke any English when she was
     <strong>
      cast
     </strong>
     in her first
     <strong>
      role
     </strong>
     in an English language movie in 1998. In a
     <strong>
      candid
     </strong>
     interview with the US broadcaster CBS, Penelope admitted: "I would lock myself in the bathroom and cry because I didn't understand what was going on on the
     <strong>
      set
     </strong>
     , because I didn't understand everything that the director was saying or what the other actors were saying."
    </p>
    <p>
     Closer to home we have the example of Ziyi Zhang. She gained international
     <strong>
      acclaim
     </strong>
     in Memoirs of a Geisha and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and received many
     <strong>
      nominations
     </strong>
     for awards. What's helped her to learn English? Well, she says she listened to Eminem songs. And as she learned the language, she realised “how rude” the
     <strong>
      lyrics
     </strong>
     were.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when it comes to acting in English, nobody has a more colourful story than Austrian Arnold Schwarzenegger. He had to be
     <strong>
      dubbed
     </strong>
     at the beginning of his career because nobody could make out what he was saying. In his next film, he played a
     <strong>
      deaf mute
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The bodybuilder turned actor claims his
     <strong>
      accent
     </strong>
     has softened, but he keeps it thick on purpose. "It's become such a big part of me that people really enjoy it," says Arnie. He's aware of the
     <strong>
      irony
     </strong>
     when he tells us: "The very things that they said would make it impossible for me to be successful in acting were the things that became my assets."
    </p>
    <p>
     Yes – the complicated name, the thick accent, the big body – nothing stopped him from doing the things he liked. So don't despair when you struggle with English. They've all been there and they've
     <strong>
      <strong>
       prevailed
      </strong>
      .
      <strong>
       Are you ready for your close up in life?
