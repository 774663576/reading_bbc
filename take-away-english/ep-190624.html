     食物在经过加工后所包含的营养成分会有所降低，这也是为什么人们普遍认为经过加工后的食品不如新鲜食材营养丰富。科学家发现，被经过 “超级加工” 的食品对人体健康带来了新的威胁。超加工食品是一种经过大量工业加工的食品，包装上通常有很长的成分表。科学家对超加工食品进行了研究，他们发现了什么？本集 “随身英语” 讨论食用超加工食品可能对人体健康产生的影响。

     It’s good to enjoy food, but sometimes stories about the dangers of eating certain things can be
     <strong>
      hard to digest
     </strong>
     . I love to
     <strong>
      tuck into
     </strong>
     a pepperoni pizza or munch on a jam doughnut, even though I know the dangers that lurk in their
     <strong>
      ingredients
     </strong>
     . It’s clear that
     <strong>
      processed foods
     </strong>
     are not the most
     <strong>
      nutritious
     </strong>
     things; but there now comes a new threat - from ultra-processed foods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Scientists have now discovered that eating these types of food - such as chicken nuggets, ice cream and breakfast cereals - have been linked to early death and poor health. This is the stuff that has been through more substantial industrial processing and often has long ingredient lists on the packet, including added
     <strong>
      preservatives
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      sweeteners
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      colour enhancers
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing that your bowl of cornflakes could be bad for you might be
     <strong>
      hard to swallow
     </strong>
     , but two studies have shown that people eating more ultra-processed food had worse heart health. Dr Mathilde Touvier from the University of Paris, who conducted one of the studies, told the BBC: "The rapid and worldwide increasing
     <strong>
      consumption
     </strong>
     of ultra-processed foods, to the detriment of less processed foods, may drive a substantial burden of
     <strong>
      cardiovascular diseases
     </strong>
     in the next decades."
    </p>
    <p>
     But it might not be completely necessary to change your
     <strong>
      diet
     </strong>
     just yet as there is still some uncertainty about the results of the study and questions still to answer. Kevin McConway, a professor of statistics at The Open University, told the BBC: "These studies do increase my confidence that there's something real behind these associations - but I'm still far from sure."
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe we should follow the advice of The US National Institutes of Health, which found that ultra-processed foods lead people to eat more and put on more weight. It suggests avoiding food containing ingredients you cannot pronounce or anything your grandmother would not recognise as food! The obvious thing to do seems to be to
     <strong>
      feast on
     </strong>
     more
     <strong>
      unprocessed
     </strong>
     foods, such as fruit, vegetables, fish, nuts and seeds, beans, lentils and
     <strong>
      wholegrains
     </strong>
     , often called a
     <strong>
      Mediterranean-style diet
     </strong>
     . After all,
     <strong>
      we are what we eat
     </strong>
     !
