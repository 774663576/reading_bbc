     What’s the first thing you remember doing? It could be playing with your friends at school, or going to a birthday party and eating amazing cake. Most of us have a
     <strong>
      treasured
     </strong>
     early memory of our childhood, but can we really believe those
     <strong>
      vivid
     </strong>
     memories? Did those special moments really happen – or did we make them up?
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s a strange
     <strong>
      concept
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      grasp
     </strong>
     , but according to research, about four out of 10 of us invent our first childhood memory. Rather than having experienced something, we could have
     <strong>
      fabricated
     </strong>
     a fake memory from videos or photos we’ve seen. We could have been influenced by a story
     <strong>
      recounted
     </strong>
     to us that
     <strong>
      spurs
     </strong>
     our minds
     <strong>
      on
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      adopt
     </strong>
     someone else’s memory as our own. What it means is that memories of our younger years, especially before the age of two, may be
     <strong>
      inaccurate
     </strong>
     , or entirely false.
    </p>
    <p>
     But why don’t we have
     <strong>
      clear
     </strong>
     memories from that age? Well, our ability to
     <strong>
      retain
     </strong>
     memories from before the age of two isn’t great. While at that age we do have
     <strong>
      short-term memories
     </strong>
     , according to Catherine Loveday, an expert in
     <strong>
      autobiographical
     </strong>
     memory at the University of Westminster, the memories that infants make are not
     <strong>
      long-lasting
     </strong>
     . This is possibly due to the rapid creation of
     <strong>
      brain cells
     </strong>
     in our early years. Some scientists also believe that as we get older, our childhood memories
     <strong>
      fade
     </strong>
     and after the age of seven, we get some kind of ‘childhood
     <strong>
      amnesia
     </strong>
     ’.
    </p>
    <p>
     So why do we create fake memories? Some experts believe that there is a clear desire for a sense of self and having a
     <strong>
      cohesive
     </strong>
     story of our existence. Creating memories can fill in the gaps – giving us a more complete structure for our early lives. As we get older, we want to have a complete picture of our entire lives.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the next time someone says they have a clear memory from when they were one – or even before - just remember that while it could be true, there’s a chance they just invented it at some point in their lives.
