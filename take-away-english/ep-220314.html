     There are many different types of houses in the UK. You may see
     <strong>
      detached
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      semi-detached
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      terraced
     </strong>
     houses or even
     <strong>
      end-of-terrace
     </strong>
     houses on a typical street. You might see
     <strong>
      mansions
     </strong>
     in more affluent parts of town, or people
     <strong>
      residing
     </strong>
     in
     <strong>
      bungalows
     </strong>
     , preferring to live a life without stairs.
     <strong>
      Quaint
     </strong>
     <strong>
      cottages
     </strong>
     may dot the countryside, while heading to the cities you could see any number of types of
     <strong>
      flats
     </strong>
     , including houses turned into
     <strong>
      converted flats
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      studios
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      duplexes
     </strong>
     . But one thing you will notice is that many houses come from different eras, and asking a British person about their
     <strong>
      ideal
     </strong>
     home, many of them will have a specific
     <strong>
      period property
     </strong>
     in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     For some, it could be
     <strong>
      Victorian
     </strong>
     houses, which are often seen with
     <strong>
      bay windows
     </strong>
     , high
     <strong>
      ceilings
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      stained glass
     </strong>
     doors and coloured
     <strong>
      brickwork
     </strong>
     . During the Victorian era, a huge number of houses, particularly terraced, were built in towns and cities to accommodate vast numbers of workers who were moving from more rural areas.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Georgian
     </strong>
     architecture refers to houses built during the period of 1714 and 1830 during the reigns of four British monarchs, all called George. Usually houses with this architectural style have a more symmetrical theme, both internally and externally, with a small square garden in front. For those not into older properties,
     <strong>
      new builds
     </strong>
     from the 1990s onwards offer better
     <strong>
      insulation
     </strong>
     against the cold and newer electrics. And those who prefer less maintenance could always go with the
     <strong>
      open-plan
     </strong>
     or minimalist look of the modern era.
    </p>
    <p>
     So whether it’s high ceilings, better insulation, brickwork, bungalows or square gardens, people in Britain have a wide variety of preferences when it comes to where they live. And their ideal home may just simply be a case of what style feels like home.
