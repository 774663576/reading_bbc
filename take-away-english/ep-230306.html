     <strong>
      词汇：persuasion 说服
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Adverts are designed to
     <strong>
      persuade
     </strong>
     us, but which techniques have been shown to be effective in
     <strong>
      enticing
     </strong>
     us to buy things?
    </p>
    <p>
     One way is simply to
     <strong>
      portray
     </strong>
     something as normal. Former
     <strong>
      advertising
     </strong>
     professional Dan Parker explains that '
     <strong>
      normalisation
     </strong>
     ', showing people happily eating unhealthily, can lead to higher sales of junk food as people start to see these habits as normal. This is like
     <strong>
      product placement
     </strong>
     , where products are shown or mentioned in TV shows and films. Beth Fossen, an assistant professor of marketing, tells us that product placement is most effective when it is not too obvious. We become defensive if we know that someone is trying to sell us something. It seems that a subtle approach can be more
     <strong>
      convincing
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Appealing
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     our
     <strong>
      emotions
     </strong>
     is another strategy that advertisers use. Some of them use fear to persuade us. Jannet Pendleton, a senior lecturer in communication studies, explains that for fear to be an effective tool, we need to believe that both the fears raised, and the possibility that our actions can make a difference are
     <strong>
      credible
     </strong>
     . Where fears are
     <strong>
      exaggerated
     </strong>
     or we feel helpless, we are likely to
     <strong>
      switch off
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Adverts often show perfect-looking people because
     <strong>
      marketers
     </strong>
     believe that we will
     <strong>
      aspire
     </strong>
     to be like them and buy the products they
     <strong>
      endorse
     </strong>
     . However, as Karen Middleton, a senior lecturer in marketing and advertising, points out, this may not be the best strategy. The research that she mentions shows these adverts can make people feel bad and
     <strong>
      put
     </strong>
     them
     <strong>
      off
     </strong>
     products. These studies say that seeing a more human and relatable side of people can
     <strong>
      sway
     </strong>
     us into believing them. David Robson, writing for BBC Worklife, explains that
     <strong>
      endorsements
     </strong>
     from characters who admit their mistakes can often be more
     <strong>
      believable
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, it seems that the secret to these persuasion techniques is that, to be most effective, they need to be used carefully. Perhaps the best technique advertisers can use to persuade people is to fully understand the people they are selling to.
