     Our working lives are becoming more flexible. The coronavirus pandemic has made us rethink how and where we work. For many, working from home has become the
     <strong>
      new norm
     </strong>
     , with some people finding the
     <strong>
      cosiest
     </strong>
     place to do this is in bed! But is this really the best place for your mind and body to carry out your job?
    </p>
    <p>
     A ‘
     <strong>
      duvet day
     </strong>
     ’ used to be an informal way of describing taking a day off sick from work, but with improvements in technology, such as good wi-fi, you can now do most of your work tasks
     <strong>
      reclining
     </strong>
     in bed while still
     <strong>
      tucked under
     </strong>
     your duvet and maybe
     <strong>
      snuggled up
     </strong>
     in your
     <strong>
      pyjamas
     </strong>
     . The benefits are obvious: no travel time to work, no need to get dressed or even get out of bed – unless you want a cup of tea!
    </p>
    <p>
     The trend seems to be growing. But for some, it’s not a matter of choice – it might be the only spare space in their home where they can work. According to a BBC online article “this is especially true of young workers; in the UK, workers aged 18 to 34 are the least likely to have a proper desk and chair and are twice as likely to work from bed than older workers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Online retailers have reported a huge increase in people searching for
     <strong>
      laptop stands
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      support pillows
     </strong>
     . Although they might make the
     <strong>
      bed-working
     </strong>
     regime more
     <strong>
      comfortable
     </strong>
     , the reality is that your long-term health, particularly your
     <strong>
      posture
     </strong>
     , could suffer. Your neck, back, hips and more are all
     <strong>
      strained
     </strong>
     when you’re on a soft surface that encourages you to
     <strong>
      slump
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      sprawl
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Working from bed can also affect your mental health. Sophie Bostock, founder of The Sleep Scientist, told the BBC: “If you don’t have a good day at work, you start to change your associations with your bed as being about
     <strong>
      stress
     </strong>
     , deadlines, an awkward conversation with your boss.” Stress, of course, can lead to
     <strong>
      insomnia
     </strong>
     and the only cure for that is a long Zoom work meeting to help you
     <strong>
      doze off
     </strong>
     !
