     We all know driving can be stressful. One minute you’re minding your own business and the next someone
     <strong>
      cuts you up
     </strong>
     .
     <strong>
      Manoeuvres
     </strong>
     like that can be annoying and irritating, but for some of us, it can make us
     <strong>
      incandescent
     </strong>
     <strong>
      with rage
     </strong>
     . So what is road rage, and what things can cause it?
    </p>
    <p>
     Road rage, simply put, is a sudden burst of anger that
     <strong>
      motorists
     </strong>
     experience when they feel angered by something another driver, cyclist or pedestrian has done. Road rage can
     <strong>
      manifest
     </strong>
     itself in several ways, including verbal or physical threats, insults, and even
     <strong>
      dangerous driving
     </strong>
     . The drivers themselves may feel anxiety and stress, which can cause them to
     <strong>
      speed
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      swerve
     </strong>
     across the road. Experts like Leon James, a professor of traffic psychology at the University of Hawaii, US, warn that experiencing these moments, especially repeatedly, could be harmful to our health due to the number of stress hormones entering our bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, what can cause us to experience road rage? Being
     <strong>
      tailgated
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      undertaken
     </strong>
     on a busy
     <strong>
      motorway
     </strong>
     , seeing someone
     <strong>
      swooping
     </strong>
     across several
     <strong>
      lanes
     </strong>
     , chatting on their phone, or
     <strong>
      hogging
     </strong>
     the middle lane in front of us are just some of the things that may stress us. And what about
     <strong>
      parking
     </strong>
     ? Someone stealing the
     <strong>
      space
     </strong>
     we wanted at the last second could
     <strong>
      tip us over the edge
     </strong>
     ! Being aware of what can
     <strong>
      trigger
     </strong>
     these feelings of rage may be key to controlling it.
    </p>
    <p>
     So what can we do to keep relaxed? Try driving in a good mood, and if you see a
     <strong>
      traffic jam
     </strong>
     , just remember that they can’t be avoided. And try leaving a little earlier in future. Also, if you see someone who is really angry, try not to maintain eye contact, and don’t get out of the car to
     <strong>
      confront
     </strong>
     them. And if you feel stressed and anxious, try
     <strong>
      pulling over
     </strong>
     somewhere and resting while you calm down.
    </p>
    <p>
     So the next time you feel stressed while driving, just remember road rage can happen to anyone – and relaxing a bit when you feel that way may not just make it safer for you, but for others too.
