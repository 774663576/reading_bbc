     在欧洲，一项新的规定要求饮料瓶的瓶盖需要和瓶子拴在一起，使其难以和瓶子分开。有不少人对这项规定感到不解，认为这让饮料瓶使用起来很不方便。但实际上，瓶盖已经成为了塑料垃圾污染的主要来源之一。本文讨论为什么摘不掉的瓶盖更有助于环保。

     Squashed noses, scratched cheeks and t-shirts covered in sticky drinks. These are just some of the things that people are complaining about following the introduction of a new style of plastic bottle lid.
     <strong>
      Regulations
     </strong>
     in Europe now require manufacturers to
     <strong>
      tether
     </strong>
     lids to plastic drink bottles, making them difficult to remove.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, the reason behind this measure is not to make people annoyed. It's because when lids get separated from their bottles, they become a big problem. As they're small, bottle
     <strong>
      caps
     </strong>
     are easily
     <strong>
      discarded
     </strong>
     , representing a high percentage of the plastic waste found on beaches. UK surveys reported that bottle
     <strong>
      tops
     </strong>
     were the third most common type of waste found as
     <strong>
      litter
     </strong>
     . They're more
     <strong>
      buoyant
     </strong>
     than bottles and so can travel further once they're in the sea. They are then often mistaken for food by sea birds or other wildlife,
     <strong>
      endangering
     </strong>
     their health. Wildlife photographer Chris Jordan, documented how Midway Atoll in the Pacific was covered with the bodies of thousands of seabirds whose stomachs were full of
     <strong>
      plastic pollution
     </strong>
     , much of it plastic bottle tops. It's not just discarded lids that can be an issue. Carefully
     <strong>
      disposed of
     </strong>
     lids can present a problem in
     <strong>
      recycling plants
     </strong>
     . They are often too small for the machinery used to
     <strong>
      sort rubbish
     </strong>
     and end up being sent to
     <strong>
      landfill
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Clever design could help reduce the scale of the problem. The way products are built can influence our behaviour. Consider a refrigerator that bleeps when left open too long. The alarm encourages us to close the door, saving
     <strong>
      energy
     </strong>
     . Renee Wever, writing in the International Journal of Sustainable Engineering highlights how metal drink can
     <strong>
      ring pulls
     </strong>
     were redesigned in the 1980s, to remain attached to the
     <strong>
      cans
     </strong>
     . This is the approach which has been taken with plastic bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
     If bottle tops are
     <strong>
      attached
     </strong>
     to bottles, they are more likely to be disposed of properly and less likely to present a problem to wildlife. Many recycling plants find it easier to recycle caps when they are attached to bottles. Could it be that making something slightly more difficult to use could make a real difference to solving our plastic waste problem.

    <p>
     2. Why are bottle lids easily discarded?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Bottle lids are easily discarded because they are small.

    <p>
     3. Why do lids travel further than bottles in the sea?
    </p>

     4. What problem can be caused by carefully disposed of bottle lids?
    </p>
