      London residents will have to
      <strong>
       make do
      </strong>
      without the
      <strong>
       chimes
      </strong>
      of Big Ben for a while. After 157 years of nearly
      <strong>
       uninterrupted
      </strong>
      service, the iconic clock in London has become
      <strong>
       worn
      </strong>
      and requires
      <strong>
       repairs
      </strong>
      .
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </span>
     <span>
      Steve Jaggs, Keeper of the Clock, said: "This project will enable us to give one of Britain's most famous
      <strong>
       landmarks
      </strong>
      the
      <strong>
       TLC
      </strong>
      it so desperately needs and deserves."
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The Elizabeth Tower, a
      <strong>
       UNESCO World Heritage Site
      </strong>
      , houses the clock and is visited by 12,000 people a year. It's said to be
      <strong>
       structurally sound
      </strong>
      but water caused damage to its
      <strong>
       masonry
      </strong>
      and there's
      <strong>
       corrosion
      </strong>
      in the
      <strong>
       cast-iron
      </strong>
      roof and belfry and the frame which holds the clock's bells. It all needs
      <strong>
       fixing
      </strong>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Work will also help to bring the building up to modern
      <strong>
       health and safety standards
      </strong>
      . It will have a lift installed to make it easier and quicker to
      <strong>
       evacuate
      </strong>
      an injured person and give access to disabled people who can't climb its 334 steps. And at a time when energy efficiency is a concern, the lights which illuminate the clock dials and the belfry will be
      <strong>
       replaced
      </strong>
      by low energy
      <strong>
       LEDs
      </strong>
      .
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      Work, with an estimated cost of £29m, is set to begin early in 2017 and is planned to take three years. The clock will be silent for only a few months though and might come back to life in very special occasions.
     </span>
    </p>
    <p>
     <span>
      The name Big Ben originally referred to the 13.5 tonne Great Bell within the tower, but ended up being used for the clock and tower too. The clock stands 96m above the
      <strong>
       Houses of Parliament
      </strong>
      . It was designed by
      <strong>
       architect
      </strong>
      Edmund Beckett Denison and began keeping time on 31 May 1859. Surely it might be our turn to give this famous symbol of Britain some time to rest and recover.
