      词汇：milk 牛奶

    <p>
     Milk, it comes from cows, right? Well, not all the milk you see on supermarket shelves is from an
     <strong>
      udder
     </strong>
     . These days we see many
     <strong>
      plant-based
     </strong>
     alternatives to
     <strong>
      dairy
     </strong>
     , such as
     <strong>
      oat
     </strong>
     , pea and
     <strong>
      soya
     </strong>
     milk. But why would someone stop drinking their
     <strong>
      full-fat
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      semi-skimmed
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      skimmed
     </strong>
     cow’s milk and trade it for one of these?
    </p>
    <p>
     There are many reasons someone might try alternative milks. Some people believe the alternatives are healthier than milk from cows. Those with
     <strong>
      lactose intolerance
     </strong>
     or thinking about becoming
     <strong>
      vegan
     </strong>
     might start drinking alternative milks. Also, concerns about the impact of dairy farming on the environment could be a factor. Whatever the reason, there are many alternatives to dairy out there for us to
     <strong>
      consume
     </strong>
     . But what are the differences between these other options and regular cow’s milk?
    </p>
    <p>
     Soya milk is one common alternative. According to some sources, such as healthline.com, it contains a similar amount of
     <strong>
      protein
     </strong>
     to regular milk. It is also lower in
     <strong>
      calories
     </strong>
     than some cow’s milk, which could be good for those on a diet, and often comes
     <strong>
      fortified
     </strong>
     with things like
     <strong>
      calcium
     </strong>
     and various
     <strong>
      vitamins
     </strong>
     . So, all good? Well, soya is a common
     <strong>
      allergen
     </strong>
     , and according to foodallergy.org, is one of the nine foods which cause the majority of allergic reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Almond milk
     </strong>
     is a low-calorie,
     <strong>
      low-fat
     </strong>
     drink and is naturally lactose free and has a slight
     <strong>
      nutty
     </strong>
     taste. When
     <strong>
      unsweetened
     </strong>
     , it also has lower levels of carbohydrates and sugars than some dairy options. However, even when fortified, it doesn’t provide the levels of protein seen in soya or regular milk. Then there’s
     <strong>
      coconut milk
     </strong>
     , which is low in calories and may not affect people with nut allergies as much as other options, but is lacking in protein.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whichever plant-based milk you choose, there are positives and negatives. Dieticians agree the most important thing is getting a healthy balanced diet which won’t trigger any allergies and comes with all the minerals and vitamins you need. And at the end of the day, it may just come down to which one you think tastes better.
