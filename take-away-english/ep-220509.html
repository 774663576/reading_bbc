     你喜欢蜜蜂吗？除了能带来蜂蜜以外，它们作为传粉昆虫，也是生态系统中重要的一环。近来，这类毛绒绒的小动物的数量正在持续下降，这是为什么？本期 “随身英语” 节目讨论保护蜜蜂的重要性。

     How do you feel about bees? Do you get irritated when they
     <strong>
      buzz
     </strong>
     around you and do you fear their mission is just to
     <strong>
      sting
     </strong>
     you? Love them or loathe them, these little
     <strong>
      insects
     </strong>
     are extremely important creatures, and without them we might starve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Bees deserve some respect – they give us honey, and they play their part either
     <strong>
      pollinating
     </strong>
     the many vegetables and fruits we eat directly or pollinating the food for the animals that we then consume. In fact, they are the world’s most important
     <strong>
      pollinators
     </strong>
     . That’s not all – a study by the University of Reading in the UK, found bees and other pollinating insects have a global economic value of around £120bn ($150bn) and contribute around £690m ($850m) to the UK economy every year.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, bees are worth protecting, and although a small number of bee
     <strong>
      species
     </strong>
     are vital for crops such as
     <strong>
      oilseed rape
     </strong>
     , apples and strawberries, experts say we should be taking care of all our bees. Researchers say
     <strong>
      conservation
     </strong>
     efforts should be aimed at a wide number of species – even those that currently contribute little to crop pollination – in order to maintain
     <strong>
      biodiversity
     </strong>
     and ensure future food security.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately, in recent times, bee populations have been declining due to
     <strong>
      pesticides
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      parasites
     </strong>
     , disease and
     <strong>
      habitat loss
     </strong>
     . It’s something we should be worried about because, as Gill Perkins, chief executive of the Bumblebee Conservation Trust, told BBC Future website: “They provide a whole
     <strong>
      ecosystem
     </strong>
     service.” The recent lockdowns caused by the coronavirus pandemic seem to have given bee populations a little boost because they faced less human disturbance, traffic and polluting fumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Conservationists hope, going forward, people will appreciate bees more and encourage them to
     <strong>
      thrive
     </strong>
     as they reconnect with
     <strong>
      nature
     </strong>
     . Gill Perkins says, “They are beginning to realise how their mental health and wellbeing is supported by nature – particularly by
     <strong>
      bumblebees
     </strong>
     , which are so iconic and beautiful and buzzy.” So, it really seems time to
     <strong>
      give
     </strong>
     bees
     <strong>
      a second chance
     </strong>
     .
