     匹克球是一种用球拍击球的运动。这项运动使用的球身较轻，它被看作是网球、羽毛球和乒乓球运动的结合体。匹克球运动对身体的冲击较小，老少皆宜。也正是因此，这项运动在英国越来越受欢迎。本期 “随身英语” 介绍这个新兴运动以及它受欢迎的原因。

     <strong>
      Pickleball
     </strong>
     . It's got nothing to do with pickles – it's a sport. It has been described as a combination of tennis,
     <strong>
      badminton
     </strong>
     and table tennis. Picture a small plastic ball
     <strong>
      soaring
     </strong>
     through the air that you need to
     <strong>
      bat
     </strong>
     back to your partner, or partners.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many Brits are listening to their inner
     <strong>
      athlete
     </strong>
     and picking up this
     <strong>
      racket
     </strong>
     game. In the UK, there are currently around 7,000 players, according to Pickleball England. But the association aims to have more than 25,000 players by 2025 and is even attempting to get the sport played as part of promotion for the 2028
     <strong>
      Olympics
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     How exactly do you play this game? Well, it can be played indoors or outdoors and it can be played as a
     <strong>
      singles
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      doubles
     </strong>
     game. There are a few easy-to-understand rules. The ball is
     <strong>
      served
     </strong>
     <strong>
      underhand
     </strong>
     and should be batted
     <strong>
      diagonally
     </strong>
     across the
     <strong>
      court
     </strong>
     . On the first two hits, the ball has to
     <strong>
      bounce
     </strong>
     , but after that, players are free to
     <strong>
      volley
     </strong>
     . To win a point, the
     <strong>
      defending side
     </strong>
     must
     <strong>
      miss
     </strong>
     the ball.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, why is it popular? Firstly, it appears to be a game for all ages. The ball is
     <strong>
      lightweight
     </strong>
     because it's full of holes. This means that, when batting, there is much less
     <strong>
      impact
     </strong>
     on the body than when hitting a tennis ball, for example. Elaine Brown, who is in her 50s and a regular pickleball player, told news organisation, The Guardian why she loves the sport. "It's good exercise, it's
     <strong>
      strategic
     </strong>
     , it can be as hard or as easy as you want it to be, and most of the time it's just good fun."
    </p>
    <p>
     And the social aspect and
     <strong>
      low-impact
     </strong>
     nature of the game has been attracting players worldwide, creating a blossoming community of pickleball
     <strong>
      enthusiasts
     </strong>
     , such as celebrities Bill Gates and Leonardo DiCaprio. So, if you fancy picking it up, find your local pickleball court and give it a go!
