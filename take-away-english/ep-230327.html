     What do a student in China, an office worker in the UK and an astronaut in space all have in common? They all eat instant noodles. And they're not alone – over 100 billion
     <strong>
      servings
     </strong>
     of instant noodles are
     <strong>
      consumed
     </strong>
     globally each year, making them one of the world's most successful
     <strong>
      industrial foods
     </strong>
     . But how did this happen?
    </p>
    <p>
     Put simply, they're cheap to produce and cheap to buy, which was exactly what their
     <strong>
      creator
     </strong>
     intended. Momofuku Ando, a Japanese entrepreneur, spent a year perfecting the recipe just after the Second World War. He wanted to make something similar to traditional Japanese ramen noodles, while using the
     <strong>
      wheat flour
     </strong>
     given to Japan as
     <strong>
      food aid
     </strong>
     by the US government. His
     <strong>
      creation
     </strong>
     was instantly popular, playing a part in Japan's post-war
     <strong>
      economic rise
     </strong>
     . Even in the year 2000 – according to a poll by the Fuji Research Institute – instant noodles were voted Japan's most successful
     <strong>
      invention
     </strong>
     , ahead of high-speed trains, laptops and karaoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Japanese people are not alone in their
     <strong>
      devotion
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     instant noodles. According to the World's Instant Noodles Association, China, Indonesia, Vietnam and India – in that order – all consumed more instant noodles than Japan in 2021. Instant noodles' popularity abroad is in part due to how easy they are to
     <strong>
      adapt
     </strong>
     to local
     <strong>
      tastes
     </strong>
     . In Thailand, for example, you can get
     <strong>
      green curry flavour
     </strong>
     , while in Mexico the noodles are
     <strong>
      garnished
     </strong>
     <strong>
      with
     </strong>
     lime and
     <strong>
      salsa
     </strong>
     . And it seems that
     <strong>
      consumers
     </strong>
     have grown to expect
     <strong>
      innovation
     </strong>
     . Nissin, the food company founded by Ando,
     <strong>
      launches
     </strong>
     over 300 products yearly, just in Japan, according to employee Kasura Suzuki.

     Instant noodles have their critics, too. Their rise in popularity has
     <strong>
      come at
     </strong>
     an environmental
     <strong>
      cost
     </strong>
     – they're made with
     <strong>
      palm oil
     </strong>
     , contributing to deforestation, and their packaging is plastic. And while they are a hot, tasty and
     <strong>
      filling
     </strong>
     meal, instant noodles don't have much
     <strong>
      nutritional value
     </strong>
     , and include high levels of salt and fat. Nevertheless, instant noodles are undoubtedly
     <strong>
      lifesavers
     </strong>
     in emergency or extreme situations.
    </p>
    <p>
     More than 60 years after their invention, instant noodles have become the
     <strong>
      default
     </strong>
     food for anyone short on money, time, or even a kitchen.
