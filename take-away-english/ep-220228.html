     When you go on holiday, where do you like to stay? Do you like the luxury of a
     <strong>
      five-star
     </strong>
     hotel, the convenience of a
     <strong>
      self-catering
     </strong>
     apartment or do you prefer the freedom of sleeping
     <strong>
      under canvas
     </strong>
     ? If you haven’t tried the latter, maybe you should join the increasing number of people who are enjoying the simple pleasures of
     <strong>
      camping
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     By grabbing your
     <strong>
      tent
     </strong>
     , and some additional
     <strong>
      accessories
     </strong>
     , it’s easy to head off to the countryside and enjoy a night or two
     <strong>
      under the stars
     </strong>
     . Many
     <strong>
      campers
     </strong>
     are
     <strong>
      ditching
     </strong>
     the trappings of their modern, hectic life to do this, encouraged by experts who say a few peaceful nights in
     <strong>
      the middle of nowhere
     </strong>
     might be a good way to unwind and improve our sleep patterns and well-being. It is also, of course, a good
     <strong>
      low-budget
     </strong>
     holiday option.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the
     <strong>
      adventurous
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      wild camping
     </strong>
     is the ultimate escape from reality. Armed with just some food and a
     <strong>
      sleeping bag
     </strong>
     , you’re free from rules, away from other people, and able to enjoy the
     <strong>
      back-to-basics
     </strong>
     experience. One wild camper, Phoebe Smith, told the BBC: “The act of sleeping when everybody else has gone home – when you notice the wildlife and the stars – is one of the best things in life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     But for those who still want some
     <strong>
      home comforts
     </strong>
     , a
     <strong>
      campsite
     </strong>
     is a more suitable place to
     <strong>
      pitch
     </strong>
     your tent. Here you have
     <strong>
      facilities
     </strong>
     such as washrooms, a shop and maybe even a restaurant. And for the most luxurious camping experience, you could try
     <strong>
      glamping
     </strong>
     . In the UK, camping – and
     <strong>
      caravanning
     </strong>
     – has always been popular. One survey by Visit Britain found around 4.38 million people go camping in Britain every year.
    </p>
    <p>
     More recently, sales of camping gear have jumped as more people have opted for a
     <strong>
      staycation
     </strong>
     within the UK due to travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic. One camping retailer, Halfords, reported a surge in demand for products such as
     <strong>
      stoves
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      cool boxes
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      camping chairs
     </strong>
     . With the addition of
     <strong>
      inflatable mattresses
     </strong>
     and pillows, powerful
     <strong>
      torches
     </strong>
     and lamps to light up your tent and a better selection of easy-to-cook food, you can almost guarantee a comfortable and enjoyable camping expedition. The only thing you can’t guarantee, in the UK at least, is good weather! So maybe it’s time to
     <strong>
      slum it
     </strong>
     and give camping a try.
