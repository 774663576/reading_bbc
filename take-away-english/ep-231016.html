     地球正在升温，这个现象在人口密集的城市尤其明显。城市中的混凝土建筑和道路会吸收并锁住热量；同时，虽然人们家中安装的空调可以让室内变得凉爽，但这增加了二氧化碳的排放量。本文介绍为保持城市生活舒适度应运而生的可持续创新降温方法。

     We're all familiar with the idea of climate change and how our planet is warming.
     <strong>
      Extremes
     </strong>
     in temperature have become more commonplace, making parts of the world difficult to live in. But one place where
     <strong>
      excessive heat
     </strong>
     is making life very uncomfortable is our cities. Luckily,
     <strong>
      innovation
     </strong>
     might be
     <strong>
      keeping a lid on it
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     As
     <strong>
      thermometers
     </strong>
     record temperatures, sometimes above 50 degrees Celsius, solutions are being sought to cool the air in our cities. In India, for example,
     <strong>
      heatwaves
     </strong>
     and rapid
     <strong>
      urbanisation
     </strong>
     have led to a big rise in the use of
     <strong>
      air-conditioning units
     </strong>
     , adding to CO2 emissions. So, architects, looking for a
     <strong>
      sustainable
     </strong>
     cooling solution, are reviving an ancient 'lattice' design, used in old buildings like the Taj Mahal, to construct comfortable,
     <strong>
      low-carbon
     </strong>
     buildings. Yatin Pandya told the BBC: "Traditional architectural forms have proven their performance in
     <strong>
      combatting
     </strong>
     environmental conditions."
    </p>
    <p>
     In America, about 80% of the population lives in cities, and it's these cities that suffer from an
     <strong>
      urban heat island effect
     </strong>
     , caused by factors such as
     <strong>
      trapped waste heat
     </strong>
     , concrete structures and pavements absorbing the sun and tall buildings blocking the wind. Residents and developers have tried to
     <strong>
      heatproof
     </strong>
     these places by planting large trees that offer
     <strong>
      shade
     </strong>
     and putting plants and gardens on top of roofs that use
     <strong>
      vegetation
     </strong>
     to help trap heat. And in Los Angeles, there's an experiment to cover streets with light-coloured material that
     <strong>
      reflects
     </strong>
     rather than absorbs the sun and so they remain cooler than typical black roads.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it's satellites in space that are really giving us the best picture of our
     <strong>
      over-heated
     </strong>
     cities. Glynn Hulley, who is leading an image-capturing project, called the Land Surface Temperature Monitoring mission, told the BBC: "The data can be used to identify
     <strong>
      hotspots
     </strong>
     , vulnerable regions, and assess the
     <strong>
      cooling
     </strong>
     impacts of heat
     <strong>
      mitigation
     </strong>
     approaches." It's already found how
     <strong>
      green
     </strong>
     <strong>
      spaces
     </strong>
     , white roads and
     <strong>
      water
     </strong>
     <strong>
      features
     </strong>
     , have helped prevent our cities from
     <strong>
      boiling
     </strong>
     <strong>
      over
     </strong>
     . But with excessive heat still posing a threat to our lives, more solutions are still needed.
