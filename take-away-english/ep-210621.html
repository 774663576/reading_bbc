     <strong>
      Rolling hills
     </strong>
     and endless green
     <strong>
      pastures
     </strong>
     – those images are easy to conjure when thinking of the
     <strong>
      idyllic
     </strong>
     country lifestyle. When lockdowns descended upon many countries across the world during the pandemic, social media seemed to be dominated by pictures of
     <strong>
      cottages
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      village
     </strong>
     life – people
     <strong>
      getting away from it all
     </strong>
     . So, why is living in the countryside becoming a modern fantasy – and are there benefits to considering a slower
     <strong>
      pace of life
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     It makes sense that some people would want to give up the crowded and noisy city streets for the perceived
     <strong>
      tranquillity
     </strong>
     of the traditional country life – especially during an event like a pandemic. The lockdowns and extensive periods of working from home have given people time to think about what they want from life. But it’s not just about having a greener place to look at out your window.
    </p>
    <p>
     There is more evidence that relates to the benefits of
     <strong>
      rural
     </strong>
     living. Villages aren’t normally subject to the stop-go traffic we see in city centres, the buses fighting with taxis for dominance, or metro systems with trains that scream from one station to the next. In short, there’s less
     <strong>
      air pollution
     </strong>
     in your country
     <strong>
      retreat
     </strong>
     – a thing which increases the chances of developing respiratory conditions or heart disease. You also get more opportunities to take long walks and see the sights, meaning you can get more exercise. Less noise, more walks and better air can also lead to less stress and an increased
     <strong>
      life expectancy
     </strong>
     , according to studies such as one conducted by the British government in 2012.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, there are some things that need to be considered. Living far from the
     <strong>
      hustle and bustle
     </strong>
     of the city means that some people may feel
     <strong>
      isolated
     </strong>
     or even lonely. And as people get older, life far from doctors or public transport could become a bit of a challenge. So, if you’re considering a change of pace and moving to a
     <strong>
      picturesque
     </strong>
     village, there is a range of pros and cons to consider before
     <strong>
      taking the plunge
     </strong>
     .
