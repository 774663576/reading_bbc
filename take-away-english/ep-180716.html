     跳舞是我们无法自控的一个本能反应。当好心情遇到美妙动听的旋律时，我们不由自主地挪动双脚，翩翩起舞，放飞烦恼。然而是什么驱使我们情不自禁地跟着节奏摆动身体？本集《随身英语》讨论舞蹈的益处，以及为什么专家认为它是人类培育的一种生存方式。

     If you asked me to dance, I'd probably freeze on the spot. I lack
     <strong>
      rhythm
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      coordination
     </strong>
     and some people say I have
     <strong>
      two left feet
     </strong>
     ! But with some persuasion and
     <strong>
      Dutch courage
     </strong>
     I can be tempted to take to the dance floor and
     <strong>
      shake some moves
     </strong>
     – and that, apparently, is only natural.
    </p>
    <p>
     Experts have found as well as being fun, dancing might have helped us to survive as a species.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Evolutionary anthropologist
     </strong>
     Bronwyn Tarr from the University of Oxford has been telling the BBC World Service CrowdScience programme that when we dance with others, we are rewarded with feel-good
     <strong>
      endorphins
     </strong>
     that change how we feel about ourselves and those around us.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dancing alone is one thing but it's dancing as a group that makes our brain reward us with a cocktail of feel-good
     <strong>
      hormones
     </strong>
     and is likely to lead to profound social effects. It's being
     <strong>
      in-sync
     </strong>
     with others that makes us happy. She says that "dancing
     <strong>
      fosters
     </strong>
     social closeness between people. It helps us build
     <strong>
      social connections
     </strong>
     and communities. In our past, those social connections would have been critical for surviving."
    </p>
    <p>
     You certainly need the right kind of music to help you
     <strong>
      shimmy
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      boogie
     </strong>
     or even
     <strong>
      twerk
     </strong>
     , but once you get the right beat and
     <strong>
      get into the groove
     </strong>
     with others, it can be an
     <strong>
      uplifting
     </strong>
     experience. Even my cringeworthy
     <strong>
      dad dancing
     </strong>
     makes me feel good sometimes. And in Swindon in the UK, this 'style' of dancing has been taken to a new level, where babies, attached to their fathers' chests in a sling, have been dancing with the aim of increasing the
     <strong>
      bond
     </strong>
     between parent and child.
    </p>
    <p>
     Dance is also a good way to keep fit and improve our mental health. In Wales there have been calls for doctors to
     <strong>
      prescribe
     </strong>
     dance classes to people who are unwell. The Arts Council of Wales claims there are many health benefits. And Bronwyn Tarr says "more and more we're actually discovering that your
     <strong>
      longevity
     </strong>
     – your life expectancy – is predicted by the social connections that you have… still today it's something we should do more of."
    </p>
    <p>
     It could be part of being an uptight Englishman that makes me a reluctant dancer. Look at other nationalities such as Cubans where dancing is at the heart of their
     <strong>
      cultural identity
     </strong>
     . And in Brazil at Carnival time, people
     <strong>
      let their hair down
     </strong>
     by dancing together day and night. They seem to be having a good time – so maybe I should get on my feet and dance!
