     处理多余的旧物是很多人日常生活中的一大难题。有些东西虽然不再需要，但扔掉又可惜。在英国，人们经常会把多余的衣服、书籍等物品捐给慈善义卖商店，这些商店随后会以折扣价把它们转卖出去，从而帮助那些真正有需要的贫困者。本集《随身英语》介绍英国慈善商店的前世今生。

     What do you do with old stuff? That top you bought for a party three years ago, for example. You wore it once and it's been hanging in your wardrobe ever since. You could
     <strong>
      throw
     </strong>
     it
     <strong>
      away
     </strong>
     , but that seems
     <strong>
      wasteful
     </strong>
     – after all it's still perfectly
     <strong>
      usable
     </strong>
     . So, what to do? In the UK, we might take it to a
     <strong>
      charity shop
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The first charity shops appeared in Britain in the 19th Century. The Salvation Army, a UK charity, was one of the first to run a
     <strong>
      second-hand
     </strong>
     clothing shop to provide the
     <strong>
      impoverished
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      needy
     </strong>
     with affordable clothes. This was followed by charities such as the British Red Cross, who also
     <strong>
      relieved
     </strong>
     <strong>
      hardship
     </strong>
     and raised money for the war effort during World War Two. The modern form we know today was opened in 1947 by Oxfam.
    </p>
    <p>
     These days, charity shops are a common sight with around 11,200 shops across the UK, according to the Charity Retail Association. During business hours any member of the public can
     <strong>
      donate
     </strong>
     their
     <strong>
      unwanted
     </strong>
     items to a charity shop – clothes, books, electronics, furniture. Most charity shops will take anything. These items are checked for
     <strong>
      wear and tear
     </strong>
     and if found still
     <strong>
      serviceable
     </strong>
     , priced up to be sold at a heavily discounted price.
    </p>
    <p>
     For many, this is a win-win situation. To the charity, it means a valuable source of revenue, which they can use to pursue their charitable aim. To the consumer, it provides the opportunity to buy, often extremely cheaply, items and clothes. Though
     <strong>
      previously
     </strong>
     <strong>
      owned
     </strong>
     , they are
     <strong>
      durable
     </strong>
     . To the donator, it
     <strong>
      declutters
     </strong>
     and may help to assuage consumer guilt. “You can make a pretty good case to yourself that you are
     <strong>
      doing good
     </strong>
     , because what you are doing is going towards a
     <strong>
      charitable cause
     </strong>
     [and] you are saving stuff from landfill,” Clare Press, fashion journalist and
     <strong>
      sustainable
     </strong>
     style advocate, tells the Guardian. Indeed, approximately £140 million worth of clothing alone goes into landfill each year, according to UK charity WRAP, the Waste and Resources Action Programme.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are sometimes
     <strong>
      hidden treasures
     </strong>
     for the buyers, too. On more than one occasion a buyer has purchased something very cheaply, only to later discover its true value – such as a screen print bought for 99p and later found to be by English artist Ben Nicholson. It sold at auction for £4,200. So next time you need to rid yourself of something, spare a thought for the charity shop – after all,
     <strong>
      charity begins at home
