     有些人认为幽默感和开怀大笑是人类独有的特质。但动物行为学家们可能不同意这个观点。有大量证据表明动物们像人类一样喜欢互相逗乐，而且它们这样做完全是出于好玩！听 “随身英语” 节目探讨狗、黑猩猩、海豚和老鼠开玩笑的方式。

     <strong>
      Laughter
     </strong>
     is a universal language for humans to connect with each other and form social bonds. Even as babies, we
     <strong>
      giggle
     </strong>
     when our parents
     <strong>
      pull funny faces
     </strong>
     , and then gradually learn to
     <strong>
      make
     </strong>
     others
     <strong>
      laugh
     </strong>
     as we grow up. But, is it a uniquely human experience? Scientists have observed behaviours in animals that suggest that your pets might be secret
     <strong>
      jokesters
     </strong>
     …
    </p>
    <p>
     Have you ever seen dogs let people come close to their toy, and then
     <strong>
      playfully
     </strong>
     run away with it? Biologist Charles Darwin saw this as the dog's version of a
     <strong>
      practical joke
     </strong>
     . Marc Bekoff, biology professor at the University of Colorado, also observed dogs playfully
     <strong>
      teasing
     </strong>
     each other by approaching slowly and then quickly running away. His work concluded that dogs just want to
     <strong>
      have fun
     </strong>
     , and he's also said that animals may
     <strong>
      goof around
     </strong>
     as a way to cope with stress.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a 2024 study, Isabelle Laumer and colleagues watched four ape species interact with each other and observed 18 distinct teasing behaviours. They saw young apes
     <strong>
      sneak up
     </strong>
     behind an adult,
     <strong>
      poke
     </strong>
     them to surprise them and then wait and watch the response, behaviour similar to that shown by human children. So, a
     <strong>
      sense of humour
     </strong>
     may have appeared early in our evolutionary timeline.
    </p>
    <p>
     What about laughing? While playing, dogs sometimes produce a breathy snort that could sound like laughter. Dolphins let out sounds of joy when
     <strong>
      play-fighting
     </strong>
     . Rats make a
     <strong>
      joyful
     </strong>
     squeak similar to a giggle when they are
     <strong>
      tickled
     </strong>
     , says Jeffrey Burgdorf, professor at Northwestern University.
    </p>
    <p>
     But, is a rat's giggle really a sign of a sense of humour? Are the apes in Laumer's study really
     <strong>
      joking around
     </strong>
     or just attention-seeking? What would be the evolutionary purpose of animals teasing and
     <strong>
      pranking
     </strong>
     ? "In humans, humour can serve as like an ice-breaker, removing social barriers and strengthening relationships," says Laumer. "We don't know if it's the same in apes or other animals, but it's possible."
