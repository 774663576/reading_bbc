     Technology is developing
     <strong>
      by leaps and bounds
     </strong>
     . A
     <strong>
      gadget
     </strong>
     as small as a smartphone now has more
     <strong>
      processing power
     </strong>
     than rockets to the Moon once had. New
     <strong>
      tech
     </strong>
     brings many advantages, making our lives easier and opening up new opportunities. One piece of
     <strong>
      kit
     </strong>
     that’s been really taking off recently is the
     <strong>
      drone
     </strong>
     . This
     <strong>
      pilotless
     </strong>
     mini
     <strong>
      aircraft
     </strong>
     , originally developed for
     <strong>
      aerial photography
     </strong>
     and warfare, is now bringing us benefits closer to home. In the last few years, tech companies such as Amazon, Alphabet and Uber have promised us
     <strong>
      delivery drones
     </strong>
     – bringing goods to our doorsteps in a matter of minutes. Progress in developing them has, however, been slow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Drones are helping to connect with and enhance the lives of people in remote locations. In the UK, the Royal Mail wants a
     <strong>
      fleet
     </strong>
     of 500 drones to help deliver the mail to far-flung communities. Windracers, the company developing the drones, say they can fly in fog and produce 30% fewer
     <strong>
      emissions
     </strong>
     than comparable
     <strong>
      piloted
     </strong>
     aircraft. And in Coventry in the UK, construction has started on an
     <strong>
      air hub
     </strong>
     , which will act as a base for police and delivery drones. Urban-Air Port Limited is working with car-maker Hyundai on the mini-airport, known as a
     <strong>
      skyport
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Drones could also play a part in improving the health of millions of people. In Zanzibar, for example, they’re being used to
     <strong>
      spray
     </strong>
     wetlands against malaria. And writing for BBC Future website, Harriet Constable describes an incredible development project by the University of South Australia. The plan is for drones to eventually be able to
     <strong>
      survey
     </strong>
     populations for disease by reading the blood oxygen levels of humans from the air. They’ll also be able to
     <strong>
      scan
     </strong>
     for other vital signs, like coughing and a high temperature.
    </p>
    <p>
     It seems
     <strong>
      the sky’s the limit
     </strong>
     for what drone technology can achieve. The only thing that sometimes keeps it
     <strong>
      grounded
     </strong>
     is regulation. Writing for the BBC, Jessica Brown says: “If our skies are to become as crowded as our streets,
     <strong>
      airspace
     </strong>
     rules need updating to prevent accidents.” There are also related problems, such as
     <strong>
      noise pollution
     </strong>
     .
