     <strong>
      <em>
       词汇: 科技
      </em>
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Apple is known for technological innovation. They
     <strong>
      came up with
     </strong>
     the iPod, the iPad and the iPhone – all of which were
     <strong>
      game changers
     </strong>
     . But their latest offering has had many tech journalists
     <strong>
      scratching their heads.
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Why? Their new smartphone has been released without the humble headphone
     <strong>
      jack
     </strong>
     . That's right, customers who buy an iPhone 7 will not be able to
     <strong>
      plug
     </strong>
     traditional headphones straight in to their device.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, they'll be encouraged to use 'AirPod' headphones, which connect
     <strong>
      wirelessly
     </strong>
     to the iPhone. These look much the same as the old
     <strong>
      earbuds
     </strong>
     , with one crucial difference: they’re
     <strong>
      cordless
     </strong>
     . And whilst we're all familiar with the frustration of
     <strong>
      tangled
     </strong>
     wires, the thought of two expensive bits of kit dangling
     <strong>
      precariously
     </strong>
     from our ears raises a simple question: what if they fall out?
    </p>
    <p>
     AirPods have also been
     <strong>
      derided
     </strong>
     on social media for their appearance, with people saying they look like mini-hairdryers, like electric toothbrushes, and even like cartoon dog Snoopy. Others claim the change is about profit, as old headphones are now
     <strong>
      obsolete
     </strong>
     without an
     <strong>
      adapter
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Apple themselves admit the move has taken "courage", and insist the new approach saves vital space inside the phone, as well as making devices more water- and
     <strong>
      dust-resistant
     </strong>
     . AirPods also
     <strong>
      double as
     </strong>
     microphones and can be used to control the iPhone with just your voice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So, could this mark the demise of one of the longest-standing technologies? The simple 3.5mm headphone jack was first used in
     <strong>
      transistor radios
     </strong>
     as far back as the 1950s, and earlier versions go even further to the telephone
     <strong>
      switchboards
     </strong>
     of the late 1800s.
    </p>
    <p>
     Regardless, with a falling
     <strong>
      share price
     </strong>
     and strong, innovative competition, Apple needed to do something bold. Time will tell if their headphone strategy will help
     <strong>
      cut through the noise
     </strong>
     .
