     It’s good to
     <strong>
      share
     </strong>
     , right? Growing up as kids we are told to share our toys and not be selfish. We also live in an age where discussing our feelings is encouraged. But when does it all become too much? With new
     <strong>
      crazes trending
     </strong>
     all the time, such as dance challenges and wearing a pillow as a dress, the question is: when can sharing become
     <strong>
      oversharing
     </strong>
     on
     <strong>
      social media
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     What is oversharing? The term has become associated with social media, but it isn’t exclusive to this
     <strong>
      platform
     </strong>
     . Imagine you head to a party and you meet someone. Within five minutes they have
     <strong>
      divulged
     </strong>
     <strong>
      intimate details
     </strong>
     about their life. While some of us may try to escape these people, according to marriage therapist Carolyn Cole, this form of oversharing could come from a strong desire to
     <strong>
      connect
     </strong>
     with someone. But how does this translate to social media?
    </p>
    <p>
     Dr Christopher Hand, a lecturer in
     <strong>
      cyberpsychology
     </strong>
     , says the more details people
     <strong>
      disclose
     </strong>
     , the less
     <strong>
      sympathy
     </strong>
     we express when things go wrong. This could be due to a belief that we attract our own negative experiences the more we share them. It seems that
     <strong>
      sadfishing
     </strong>
     , the idea of searching for sympathy by oversharing, is generally perceived as negative rather than the
     <strong>
      cry for help
     </strong>
     it could actually be.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, Dr Hand’s research also seems to suggest that the more we
     <strong>
      post
     </strong>
     on a platform, the more socially attractive we become – provided that the
     <strong>
      posts
     </strong>
     that we
     <strong>
      bang out
     </strong>
     are positive. Even back in 2015, Gwendolyn Seidman PhD, said that we should avoiding
     <strong>
      whining
     </strong>
     and being negative online. We should also steer clear of
     <strong>
      showing off
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      bragging
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      flexing
     </strong>
     , as it’s now known – especially about our love lives. It makes sense – if your date is going ‘that well’, would you really have time to share a photo with text?
    </p>
    <p>
     So, how can you know if you are oversharing? Well, why not ask your friends
     <strong>
      in real life
     </strong>
     . They would probably be more than happy to tell you if your posts about your breakfast or your gripes about your lack of money really are too much.
