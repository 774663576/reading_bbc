     眼下最新的城市交通出行方式是骑电动滑板车。这种新型交通工具使人们从一地到另一地的出行过程变得既简单又便宜。不过至少在英国，法律对在哪里可以骑电动滑板车是有限制的。人们对在公路上使用滑板车的安全系数也有顾虑。本集 “随身英语” 介绍这个时髦的交通工具。

     If you look around the streets of London, you’ll see the many methods people use to move around. Whether it’s on a
     <strong>
      commute
     </strong>
     to work, a trip to the shops, or a
     <strong>
      sightseeing excursion
     </strong>
     , there are people on buses,
     <strong>
      the Tube
     </strong>
     , cars, motorbikes, bicycles and even roller skates. The roads are already
     <strong>
      congested
     </strong>
     ; and now there’s a new addition: electric, or 'e-scooters'.
    </p>
    <p>
     This traditional children’s vehicle has become more sophisticated over the years. And now, with the addition of a small
     <strong>
      electric motor
     </strong>
     , it’s become a cheap and easy mode of transport.
     <strong>
      Scooting
     </strong>
     around town can be fun and doesn’t involve much effort, so it’s no wonder they’re becoming increasingly popular in cities around the world. But following what’s believed to be the first fatal accident involving an electric scooter in the UK, questions are being asked about their safety and whether
     <strong>
      traffic laws
     </strong>
     should be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Some scooter
     <strong>
      riders
     </strong>
     have been seen on
     <strong>
      pavements
     </strong>
     ; others on the road
     <strong>
      jumping red
     </strong>
     <strong>
      traffic lights
     </strong>
     , adding to the frustration of
     <strong>
      motorists
     </strong>
     stuck in
     <strong>
      jams
     </strong>
     . In the UK, the law states that riding one on the
     <strong>
      public highway
     </strong>
     or pavement is forbidden. Riders currently face a £300
     <strong>
      fixed-penalty notice
     </strong>
     and six points on their driving licence for doing so. But, despite this, it seems the increasing popularity of e-scooters means they can be seen everywhere. And now users are calling on regulations to be changed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The UK government is looking at how safely they can be used on the road and is ‘reviewing’ the law. But its transport minister, Michael Ellis, has told the BBC that: "
     <strong>
      Micromobility
     </strong>
     products are appearing in countries across the globe and are an exciting innovation for which we know there is demand. However, safety must always be our top priority when considering their use on public highways in this country.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There’s no doubt there are dangers in riding a
     <strong>
      two-wheeled
     </strong>
     scooter. Despite the fact that some of them can exceed 30mph, they sometimes only have one
     <strong>
      brake
     </strong>
     and no lights. They also become unstable if the rider hits a
     <strong>
      pothole
     </strong>
     , and however confident the rider may be, larger
     <strong>
      vehicles
     </strong>
     on the road make them vulnerable. So it seems more work needs to be done to give e-scooters a safe and legal space to travel in.
