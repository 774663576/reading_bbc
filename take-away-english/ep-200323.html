     It's the most popular drink worldwide. According to the British Coffee Association, approximately two billion cups of coffee are consumed every day. But after the beans have been picked,
     <strong>
      roasted
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      brewed
     </strong>
     , the
     <strong>
      grounds
     </strong>
     are often
     <strong>
      disposed
     </strong>
     of as
     <strong>
      waste
     </strong>
     . With the environment and
     <strong>
      resource
     </strong>
     <strong>
      consumption
     </strong>
     such hot topics at the moment, wouldn't it be great if we could
     <strong>
      reuse
     </strong>
     this waste to make something useful? Well, you can.
    </p>
    <p>
     The company OCHIS
     <strong>
      manufactures
     </strong>
     sunglasses. Max Havrylenko, founder of the company, was searching for an alternative
     <strong>
      substance
     </strong>
     to plastic. He wanted to 'solve the problem of plastic use and overconsumption', he told the BBC. OCHIS
     <strong>
      fuses
     </strong>
     the grounds with vegetable oils, forming a
     <strong>
      bond
     </strong>
     . These are
     <strong>
      pressed
     </strong>
     into plates which are
     <strong>
      durable
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      flexible
     </strong>
     . These are then cut into the arms and frames of the glasses. "Don't worry," he says, "They won't
     <strong>
      dissolve
     </strong>
     in the rain."

     Rosalie McMillan, a London jeweller, uses recycled coffee grounds along with gold and silver to make
     <strong>
      handcrafted
     </strong>
     jewellery. She mixes the coffee with oils and
     <strong>
      subjects
     </strong>
     it
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     heat and
     <strong>
      pressure
     </strong>
     to create a
     <strong>
      compound
     </strong>
     she calls 'Çurface'. Her website claims it has a 'beautiful surface quality and texture' with similar
     <strong>
      properties
     </strong>
     to hardwood.

     What about a coffee cup made from them? Kaffeeform is a German-based company that transforms used grounds and renewable plant-based raw materials into a durable
     <strong>
      composite
     </strong>
     . This is shaped into a variety of containers and
     <strong>
      polished
     </strong>
     and finished, ready to be sold. So, you can drink your coffee from a cup made of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it doesn't stop there. Even without a factory, you can make use of coffee grounds. They make excellent fertiliser. You can exfoliate with them, or mix them with water to make a sepia-toned paint. And the list goes on. So next time you finish your morning cup, save the grounds.
