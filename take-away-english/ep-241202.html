     “Polyglot” 的意思是 “通晓多国语言的人”。你知道他们都有哪些学习语言的窍门吗？有的人认为，能通晓多国语言的人通常对语言学习抱有很强的动力和兴趣；还有人发现，他们中的一些人会从尝试用口语和他人对话开始学习一门新语言。本文讨论 “polyglot” 学习语言的方法有哪些优点和劣势。

     How many languages do you speak? For most people, it can be hard learning just one
     <strong>
      foreign language
     </strong>
     . Lydia Machova, a Slovakian
     <strong>
      polyglot
     </strong>
     and language mentor, is currently
     <strong>
      fluent
     </strong>
     in seven foreign languages and says she likes to learn a new language every two years! So how do polyglots like Lydia learn multiple languages successfully, and what can we learn from their methods?
    </p>
    <p>
     Lydia wanted to find out the different techniques polyglots use, and she found a wide variety of methods. Some use
     <strong>
      language exchange
     </strong>
     apps to find
     <strong>
      native
     </strong>
     speakers so that they can start speaking from day one. Others watch series they love with
     <strong>
      subtitles
     </strong>
     , and some use techniques like 'shadowing' – listening to and repeating
     <strong>
      target
     </strong>
     <strong>
      language
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      master
     </strong>
     <strong>
      pronunciation
     </strong>
     . Kato Lomb was described by the
     <strong>
      linguist
     </strong>
     Krashen as "possibly the most
     <strong>
      accomplished
     </strong>
     polyglot in the world". She was a Hungarian who spoke 16 languages! Her approach to learning focussed on
     <strong>
      extensive
     </strong>
     <strong>
      reading
     </strong>
     and self-study. So, while there are lots of different approaches, in her 2019 TED Talk, Lydia concluded that the one thing polyglots all have in common is an interest and
     <strong>
      motivation
     </strong>
     to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, some linguists argue that viral videos showing polyglots switching between languages often rely on
     <strong>
      memorised
     </strong>
     <strong>
      phrases
     </strong>
     rather than proving genuine
     <strong>
      conversational
     </strong>
     <strong>
      ability.
     </strong>
     Benny Lewis, author and creator of the website
     <em>
      Fluent in 3 Months,
     </em>
     thinks it's important to be open and honest about your
     <strong>
      competency
     </strong>
     in a language. Hediscusses having varying levels of
     <strong>
      proficiency
     </strong>
     in the languages he speaks, from basic conversation to near-native fluency.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, the professionals say enjoy yourself when learning. We recommend you try some of these suggestions, find the right method for you and
     <strong>
      stick
     </strong>
     <strong>
      to
     </strong>
     it!
