     Let’s face it – most of us can’t resist a cup of tea or coffee sometimes. They’re a perfect
     <strong>
      pick-me-up
     </strong>
     and comforter. But there are alternative beverages, so why have we chosen these as our go-to drinks to soothe our
     <strong>
      hectic
     </strong>
     lives? And which one is superior?
    </p>
    <p>
     Let’s start with tea – it’s the second most consumed drink in the world. For many – especially the British – having a ‘cuppa’ is a daily
     <strong>
      ritual
     </strong>
     . The caffeine contained in it helps wake you up in the morning, and throughout the day we’ll make a brew to distract us from our work or to be
     <strong>
      sociable
     </strong>
     . And according to some scientists,
     <strong>
      habitual
     </strong>
     tea consumption can have some
     <strong>
      health benefits
     </strong>
     . Andrew Steptoe, a professor from University College London’s Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, told BBC Food that drinking black tea “may speed up recovery from the daily
     <strong>
      stresses
     </strong>
     in life… but we do not know what ingredients of tea were responsible for these effects on stress recovery and
     <strong>
      relaxation
     </strong>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Coffee is tea’s ‘trendier’ rival. Its popularity has grown over the years, and this is reflected in the number of coffee shops we see around – places to
     <strong>
      hang out
     </strong>
     , do business or
     <strong>
      catch up
     </strong>
     with friends. Coffee can taste great and can be served in many ways, but it’s sometimes how you have it that can be seen as a
     <strong>
      status symbol
     </strong>
     or the preserve of
     <strong>
      hipsters
     </strong>
     ! Of course, it gives you a strong caffeine hit – roughly double of that contained in tea. However, too much can lead to
     <strong>
      anxiety
     </strong>
     . Sleep scientist Matt Walker told the BBC that caffeine can decrease the amount of restorative deep sleep you have.
    </p>
    <p>
     But some scientists say drinking coffee – and green tea – can also be good for us. Researchers at Osaka University linked drinking a daily cup of coffee with a lower risk of death among both stroke survivors and healthy people, while drinking seven or more cups of green tea was associated with a lower risk of death among both heart attack and stroke survivors. So, whether we turn to coffee or tea for its taste, its image or as a
     <strong>
      lifestyle choice
     </strong>
     , it could be a
     <strong>
      lifesaver
     </strong>
