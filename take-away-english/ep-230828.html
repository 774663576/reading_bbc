     大象体型庞大，令人惊叹，但其特别之处远不止如此。其实，象群中存在一种社群文化，它们多代群居共生，年轻的大象向年长的大象学习。科学家们还发现，当一头大象死亡时，其它的象群成员会一同表示哀悼。此外，大象还拥有惊人的记忆力，事实证明这个能力有助其生存。听节目探讨象群中的社群结构。

     As well as impressive
     <strong>
      physical
     </strong>
     <strong>
      attributes
     </strong>
     , elephants have a rich cultural
     <strong>
      heritage
     </strong>
     , passed down through
     <strong>
      customs
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      social
     </strong>
     <strong>
      behaviour
     </strong>
     which is learned, remembered, and shared within their
     <strong>
      herds
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     This is possible partly because of their
     <strong>
      social structure
     </strong>
     . Elephants live in complex,
     <strong>
      tightly knit
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      multigenerational
     </strong>
     societies, led by older females known as
     <strong>
      matriarchs
     </strong>
     . Younger elephants observe and
     <strong>
      mimic
     </strong>
     the behaviour of their
     <strong>
      elders
     </strong>
     , learning through experience. It helps that the herd does almost everything together, from foraging and feeding to
     <strong>
      raising
     </strong>
     each others' young. These interactions lead to deep
     <strong>
      long-lasting
     </strong>
     relationships, which can last for decades.
    </p>
    <p>
     Possibly because of these
     <strong>
      bonds
     </strong>
     , elephants seem to have
     <strong>
      emotional capacity
     </strong>
     . Just like humans, the creatures have been seen displaying signs of
     <strong>
      grief
     </strong>
     . When an elephant dies, others in the herd have been observed to repeatedly return to where the individual
     <strong>
      passed
     </strong>
     , which is said to be part of a
     <strong>
      mourning ritual
     </strong>
     . They may sniff and touch the carcass and bones and cover the site with leaves and sand. Moreover, a 2020 study by researchers Goldenberg and Wittemyer found that "elephants show broad interest in their dead regardless of the strength of former relationships with the dead individual", which may indicate advanced
     <strong>
      sentience
     </strong>
     , the scientists say.
    </p>
    <p>
     There's a saying found in many languages – 'an elephant never forgets'. In fact, memory has been essential to the
     <strong>
      survival
     </strong>
     of some elephant herds. A study within Great Kruger National Park found that, during an extreme
     <strong>
      drought
     </strong>
     in 2016, elephant groups led by matriarchs who had previously lived through a severe drought, had higher
     <strong>
      survival rates
     </strong>
     . Researchers concluded that the matriarchs likely remembered where sources of water could be located.

    <p>
     So, count yourself lucky that you live on the same planet as these immense majestic animals.
