     大家在商品促销期间并不总是理性购物。有时，我们会因为买到了物美价廉的心仪产品而兴奋开心，也会因为错过了某个受欢迎的折扣产品而遗憾难过。产生这种购物心理的原因是什么？本文介绍大脑用什么机制促使你总想买便宜货。

     Fistfights over a flat-screen TV, hours in a queue for
     <strong>
      cookware
     </strong>
     , arguments over air-fryers. Why is it that
     <strong>
      discounts
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      deals
     </strong>
     can turn a simple shopping trip into a rampage through a
     <strong>
      retail park
     </strong>
     ? What is it that makes a
     <strong>
      bargain
     </strong>
     so
     <strong>
      irresistible
     </strong>
     ?
    </p>
    <p>
     The answer might be in our heads. An fMRI study, where brain activity is measured, has shown that when we think about money we might spend, brain areas sensitive to pain are activated. When we think about the thing that we want to buy, areas sensitive to pleasure are triggered. Our
     <strong>
      medial prefrontal cortex
     </strong>
     evaluates these responses and makes a decision. If it looks like a good deal, we're more likely to make the
     <strong>
      purchase
     </strong>
     and get a hit of
     <strong>
      dopamine
     </strong>
     . Writer Mark Elwood, who has written a book all about bargains, tells us that we get even more dopamine from something that's unexpected, such as when something is surprisingly
     <strong>
      cheap
     </strong>
     . Our brains are keen to reward us for finding bargains and many shops are keen to take advantage of this.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Anchoring
     </strong>
     is a
     <strong>
      pricing
     </strong>
     <strong>
      strategy
     </strong>
     where we are shown an initial
     <strong>
      price
     </strong>
     , and then the real one. Popular items may be positioned next to something much more
     <strong>
      expensive
     </strong>
     , or we may see a very high previous price, next to the
     <strong>
      heavily reduced
     </strong>
     one currently available. The initial price, or anchor, conditions how we evaluate what something actually costs. Inflated anchor prices can make unreasonably high actual prices seem fair, and our brains are happy to reward us when we make the purchase. Other strategies include time limits, threatening to deprive us of our
     <strong>
      dopamine hit
     </strong>
     if we're not quick enough, and
     <strong>
      charm pricing
     </strong>
     , where we're much less worried about paying £9.99 than £10.
    </p>
    <p>
     If we know this about how our brains work and how
     <strong>
      retailers
     </strong>
     might act, what should we do? It can be useful to take time to consider what we're buying, hold on to something and walk around the shop before buying to give ourselves more time to
     <strong>
      evaluate
     </strong>
     a potential purchase. It can also be sensible to research prices before shopping, to get a better idea of what represents good
     <strong>
      value
     </strong>
     .

     4. Why do time limits make us more likely to buy things?
