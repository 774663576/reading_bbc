     Most of us dream of meeting that
     <strong>
      special someone
     </strong>
     . For lack of a better phrase, that
     <strong>
      Prince
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      Princess Charming
     </strong>
     who will sweep us off our feet. But to quote the old
     <strong>
      adage
     </strong>
     from Shakespeare, “The course of true love never did run smooth.” Sometimes our
     <strong>
      dream partner
     </strong>
     may have an unfortunate surprise to share with us – they may not live in the same town, city, country, or even on the same continent as you.
    </p>
    <p>
     And so some crazy
     <strong>
      lovebirds
     </strong>
     decide to enter into a long-distance relationship. We live in a time when the internet facilitates easier interaction with your
     <strong>
      cherished
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      treasured
     </strong>
     potential
     <strong>
      life partner.
     </strong>
     However, according to the many people who have been in long-distance relationships, there are certain
     <strong>
      pitfalls
     </strong>
     that you need to be aware of to enjoy a
     <strong>
      committed
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      monogamous
     </strong>
     relationship over the wires of the net.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many people are put off by the very idea of it. A lack of
     <strong>
      intimacy
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      companionship
     </strong>
     can act as a
     <strong>
      deterrent
     </strong>
     for some, but for those who embrace a digital distance relationship, they must accept that at times they may feel lonely. Many of us dream of that
     <strong>
      inseparable
     </strong>
     bond, often named as ‘soulmates’, and here are three tips to help you navigate this potentially tricky form of dating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Firstly, there needs to be trust. Being faithful is a
     <strong>
      prerequisite
     </strong>
     in most relationships, but you also need to be able to trust yourself not to stray. Part of the challenge is dealing with loneliness. Also, maintaining a level of
     <strong>
      self-sufficiency
     </strong>
     and setting goals is another way to help you cope. Not only does it mean you keep your independence, but also gives you more to talk about with your partner. Lastly, you need a plan – dates when you will see each other again, or where the relationship will lead to: perhaps even marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, long-distance relationships are potentially a difficult situation, but if you do meet
     <strong>
      Mr
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      Mrs Right
     </strong>
     , and they live far away, there are some steps you can take to make life a little easier.
