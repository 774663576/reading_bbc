     Have you ever loved a TV show? I mean really loved it? Like, you can’t wait to get to work to talk about it loved it? What about the
     <strong>
      cliffhanger
     </strong>
     ? That’s the unresolved situation at the end of the episode which makes you want to watch the next one. But, when will the next one be?
    </p>
    <p>
     In the past, viewers had to wait up to a week for the next episode of their favourite shows. What
     <strong>
      agony
     </strong>
     ! But, that’s not the case any more. And hand in hand with that comes a, possibly dangerous, growing social trend. We speak of
     <strong>
      binge-watching
     </strong>
     .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Binge-watching is when a person watches more than one episode of a show
     <strong>
      in quick succession
     </strong>
     . With developments in the speed and connectivity of the internet, increases in technology and the rise of
     <strong>
      on-demand
     </strong>
     entertainment companies, people can now have their favourite shows
     <strong>
      streamed
     </strong>
     directly to their television at their convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
     This behaviour is nothing new. In fact, ‘binge-watching’ has been officially listed in dictionaries since 2015. The entertainment companies recognise this behaviour and many take steps to
     <strong>
      encourage
     </strong>
     it. Often, instead of releasing each episode on a week-by-week basis, an entire series will become available
     <strong>
      concurrently
     </strong>
     . Once the episode finishes, many platforms will display
     <strong>
      pop-ups
     </strong>
     with ‘you might like’ suggestions, or will automatically play the next episode.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, this
     <strong>
      wondrous
     </strong>
     gift may in fact be a
     <strong>
      poisoned chalice
     </strong>
     . Recent research from British media
     <strong>
      watchdog
     </strong>
     Ofcom suggests that this behaviour may have become a
     <strong>
      hindrance
     </strong>
     . Out of the more than half of British adults who watch more than one episode of a show
     <strong>
      back-to-back
     </strong>
     , almost a third have admitted missing sleep or becoming tired as a result; and one quarter have
     <strong>
      neglected
     </strong>
     their household chores. Next we'll be missing work!
    </p>
    <p>
     Bingeing has other connections – binge eating, binge drinking and binge smoking. All of which are often associated with
     <strong>
      compulsive
     </strong>
     behaviour, a lack of control and a possible route to addiction. Lindsey Fussell, consumer group director at Ofcom, said: "The days of waiting a week for the next episode are largely gone, with people finding it hard to
     <strong>
      resist
     </strong>
     watching multiple episodes around the house or on the move.” If people find binge-watching hard to resist, coupled with the fact that it has shown to lead to
     <strong>
      negligence
     </strong>
     in many, are we witnessing the birth of a new type of addiction?
    </p>
    <p>
     The
     <strong>
      myriad
     </strong>
     of information and entertainment that television and online media can bring us is, many would say, a good thing. It offers us opportunities to better understand the world we live in, educate ourselves and enjoy much needed downtime. However, like any behaviour done to
     <strong>
      excess
     </strong>
     , it can become dangerous. And when the activity begins to
     <strong>
      bleed
     </strong>
     into other areas, causing us to stop functioning – then it becomes a problem. So, what’s the answer?
     <strong>
      Moderation
     </strong>
     ! Neither a tiny amount, nor too much. After all, as the old proverb says… a little of what you fancy does you good.
