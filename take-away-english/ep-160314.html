    <p>
     We hear a lot about
     <strong>
      team building
     </strong>
     these days. Team-building
     <strong>
      gurus
     </strong>
     are hired by some
     <strong>
      corporations
     </strong>
     to lecture us on how to work more
     <strong>
      effectively
     </strong>
     with each other. And they organise
     <strong>
      awaydays
     </strong>
     - a time employees spend together away from their usual
     <strong>
      workplace
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Here in the UK, employees can take part in activities such as Zombie
     <strong>
      boot camps
     </strong>
     where military instructors train you how to fight walking 'dead people'. For the
     <strong>
      brainier
     </strong>
     office workers amongst us there are crime investigations modelled on popular TV dramas like Sherlock Holmes and CSI.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Stressed-out
     </strong>
     city workers might have
     <strong>
      ukulele
     </strong>
     lessons made available to them. Why is that a good team-building exercise? Ukulele teacher Lorraine Bow says: "The fact that they can play a musical instrument within an hour is quite a
     <strong>
      fulfilling
     </strong>
     thing, really. It's not
     <strong>
      competitive
     </strong>
     – it's quite easy to do and a bit less intimidating than a guitar…"
    </p>
    <p>
     Actually, a horse might be a bit more intimidating than an instrument. The animals are used by a company in Abu Dhabi which teaches
     <strong>
      leadership
     </strong>
     through horse training. Basically, you have to go in a yard with a horse and
     <strong>
      persuade
     </strong>
     it that you're the boss by using
     <strong>
      body language
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Kelly Eide, co-founder of True Leadership, says: "The horses don't care if your hair is purple, if you're a man or a woman, if you're old or young... It
     <strong>
      transcends
     </strong>
     all of those cultural boundaries – age, gender, religion, tradition etc. – so that's a perfect fit. And in an organization where you really need groups of people
     <strong>
      to gel
     </strong>
     , who come from backgrounds which have no common norms, you can teach that most efficiently with a horse."
    </p>
    <p>
     And the horse feels instinctively whether or not you are a natural leader. So if after you've done a good presentation your boss offers you a carrot, you'll know where he might have learnt it from.
