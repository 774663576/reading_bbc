     不少人都喜欢通过度假来放松身心。比起自行搜索、比价并分别预订机票、酒店和目的地接送等其它服务，由旅行社或旅游网站提供的打包预订既方便又实惠。这种包价旅游受到一些英国旅客的青睐。本期 “随身英语” 讨论这种度假方式的好处。

     I'm sure most of us enjoy going on holiday. It's a break from the routine and a chance to
     <strong>
      jet off
     </strong>
     somewhere with friends or family. This might involve
     <strong>
      sightseeing
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      soaking up
     </strong>
     local culture in a new
     <strong>
      destination
     </strong>
     , or it could be
     <strong>
      kicking back
     </strong>
     and lazing by a pool or on a beach. But, whatever we choose, the most convenient way to do it is on a
     <strong>
      package holiday
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     This type of
     <strong>
      vacation
     </strong>
     combines the flight,
     <strong>
      accommodation
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      transfers
     </strong>
     and sometimes the services of a
     <strong>
      rep
     </strong>
     , all into one booking. They were traditionally sold by
     <strong>
      travel agents
     </strong>
     on the high street, but as a few big-brand names closed, many are now purchased on websites. Travel journalist Simon Calder explains that the benefits of a proper package holiday are that "by booking flights and accommodation in a single transaction from a
     <strong>
      tour operator
     </strong>
     , you transfer all the risk to the company." This means it has to sort things out when things go wrong, and if the operator
     <strong>
      goes
     </strong>
     <strong>
      bust,
     </strong>
     you can get a refund.
    </p>
    <p>
     This protection can give you
     <strong>
      peace of mind
     </strong>
     , but there are other benefits too. A package holiday can also be great value. A tour company can book airplane seats and hotel rooms
     <strong>
      in bulk
     </strong>
     which means that they can negotiate better discounts for its
     <strong>
      holidaymakers
     </strong>
     . There are often deals on food and drink too, with some companies offering
     <strong>
      all-inclusive
     </strong>
     packages – although, this can discourage someone from eating outside the hotel and sampling local cuisine and helping the local economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     But with
     <strong>
      no-frills
     </strong>
     airlines offering cheap flights and websites offering cheap hotel accommodation, some of us have been tempted to be
     <strong>
      independent travellers
     </strong>
     or
     <strong>
      backpackers
     </strong>
     . While that might suit some, the package holiday offering has evolved, and, in the UK, for example, travel experts say the package holiday is growing in popularity, particularly among younger travellers. The Association of British Travel Agents told the BBC "there is a greater emphasis on
     <strong>
      personalisation
     </strong>
     , where holidaymakers can
     <strong>
      mix and match
     </strong>
     what they want to include instead of purchasing a pre-defined package." The only problem is deciding where to go!
