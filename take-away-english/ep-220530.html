     身高和体型并不代表一个人的价值，但个子高的人在特定的方面或许占一定的优势。纵观历史，人类是否越长越高？本期节目讨论人类身高的变迁和高个子的利与弊。

     How tall are you? Do you
     <strong>
      tower over
     </strong>
     your friends and family – or are they people you literally have to
     <strong>
      look up to
     </strong>
     ? Obviously, we’re not all the same, and size doesn’t really matter. But did you know that there’s a possibility that we’re all getting taller?
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, our
     <strong>
      height
     </strong>
     is out of our control – it’s a
     <strong>
      biological
     </strong>
     fact, influenced partly by
     <strong>
      genetics
     </strong>
     . The idea that being taller gives you more power and authority might be a
     <strong>
      tall story
     </strong>
     , but according to David Robson, writing for BBC Future, “on the basis of first impressions alone, taller people may have
     <strong>
      the edge
     </strong>
     .” He adds that despite some slight risks to your health, various studies have found that the greater your height, the higher you score on measures of happiness and enjoyment of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     If this makes you want to become
     <strong>
      loftier
     </strong>
     , it’s good to know that all of us are taller than we were 150 years ago – by as much as ten centimetres. Scientists have known for a long time that humans with good diets and reliable access to food tend to grow taller and
     <strong>
      mature
     </strong>
     more quickly. Adult height in some countries has
     <strong>
      rocketed
     </strong>
     as they transformed into a developed society.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a recent study, scientists have discovered a
     <strong>
      brain receptor
     </strong>
     , called MC3R, linked to our
     <strong>
      growing
     </strong>
     process. It’s thought to be the crucial link between food and sex development and growth. Professor Sir Stephen O’Rahilly from Cambridge University told the BBC: “It tells the body we’re great here, we’ve got lots of food, so grow quickly, have
     <strong>
      puberty
     </strong>
     soon and make lots of babies.” This discovery could lead to drugs to improve
     <strong>
      muscle mass
     </strong>
     and treat delayed growth, UK researchers say.
    </p>
    <p>
     For those aspiring to be taller, we need to look at the Dutch, who stand
     <strong>
      head and shoulders
     </strong>
     <strong>
      above
     </strong>
     the rest of us as the tallest people in the world. But there is a
     <strong>
      ceiling
     </strong>
     for height, and it’s reached when people achieve their genetic potential. But, of course
     <strong>
      lanky
     </strong>
     people have to
     <strong>
      stoop
     </strong>
     through doorways and struggle to fit in cars and can have joint and cardiovascular problems, so maybe we should be careful for what we wish for.
