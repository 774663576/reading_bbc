     Now here's what I call
     <strong>
      a turn-up for the books
     </strong>
     - a film star's been giving away free books on the London Underground. If you're a
     <strong>
      bookworm
     </strong>
     , a Harry Potter fan and a London Underground user then it's been an exciting month for you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Emma Watson, who starred in films
     <strong>
      based on
     </strong>
     the
     <strong>
      novels
     </strong>
     about a
     <strong>
      fictional
     </strong>
     schoolboy wizard, has been hiding books on the Tube for passengers
     <strong>
      to leaf through
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     It's part of the Books On The Underground movement, which has a simple aim: to get more people
     <strong>
      burying themselves
     </strong>
     in literature. And the way they do it is to leave
     <strong>
      tomes
     </strong>
     on trains for commuters to pick up,
     <strong>
      dip into
     </strong>
     and then leave for another lucky reader
     <strong>
      to skim
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The movement started out in 2012 and drops off about 150
     <strong>
      volumes
     </strong>
     a week in stations across the UK's capital. Talking about Watson's participation in the project, the manager of Books On The Underground, Cordelia Oxley, said, "The reaction has been phenomenal. It must be a mixture of how much everyone adores Emma, and how exciting it is to find something as wonderful as a new book on your journey."
    </p>
    <p>
     The 100 or so
     <strong>
      editions
     </strong>
     Watson left for passengers
     <strong>
      to pore over
     </strong>
     were even more special because she left a
     <strong>
      hand-written
     </strong>
     <strong>
      inscription
     </strong>
     . The paperbacks were copies of Kaya Angelou's Mom &amp; Me &amp; Mom.
    </p>
    <p>
     One person who discovered a copy of the book on the Tube said she felt like the character Charlie Bucket – a boy who finds a golden ticket to the world's greatest chocolate factory – in the Roald Dahl
     <strong>
      classic
     </strong>
     , Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Watson became a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador in the summer of 2014 and has since started
     <strong>
      devouring
     </strong>
     as many books and
     <strong>
      essays
     </strong>
     on equality and feminism as possible. She has also started her own
     <strong>
      book club
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     So, why not
     <strong>
      take a leaf out of Emma Watson's book
     </strong>
     and leave a copy of your favourite book on a train? It could make a stranger's life richer.
