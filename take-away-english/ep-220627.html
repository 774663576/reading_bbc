     Education is a good opportunity for those of us who
     <strong>
      strive
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      better
     </strong>
     ourselves. But for people in
     <strong>
      full-time
     </strong>
     employment, getting the
     <strong>
      balancing act
     </strong>
     between work and studying can prove a
     <strong>
      stumbling block
     </strong>
     . So, what are the benefits of
     <strong>
      hitting the books
     </strong>
     once in work?
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      Uni
     </strong>
     is often considered a logical step for people who wish to continue their education after school. While options of
     <strong>
      Master’s
     </strong>
     <strong>
      degrees
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      PhDs
     </strong>
     and other
     <strong>
      postgraduate qualifications
     </strong>
     exist, many students leave after obtaining their Bachelor’s and head into the world of work. After years of doing the same job, some feel adding new skills or knowledge to their locker may open up new opportunities or help them to get a promotion. Studying
     <strong>
      part-time
     </strong>
     in the evenings and weekends can be a great way to
     <strong>
      juggle
     </strong>
     responsibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
     In terms of the benefits, learning new techniques that you can bring into the workplace can make you more of an
     <strong>
      authority
     </strong>
     in your area and a
     <strong>
      go-to
     </strong>
     <strong>
      person
     </strong>
     for advice. If the business has a
     <strong>
      skills shortage
     </strong>
     , you may be able to
     <strong>
      step up to the plate
     </strong>
     and fill that gap. In short, studying more could make you more promotable down the line and more useful to the business.
    </p>
    <p>
     If you study in a classroom, your experience of the workplace could bring
     <strong>
      a
     </strong>
     <strong>
      wealth of knowledge
     </strong>
     to other students and provide real-life examples for you to draw on. You may also meet
     <strong>
      like-minded
     </strong>
     people who you can add to your professional network in the future. And while adult learners have to consider things like children, homelives and work, many adult and part-time courses are more flexible and spread over a number of years. Some courses can even be done partly or entirely online, which means that you can manage your time more easily studying from home and you don’t need to factor in travel time.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, there are a variety of options for those who wish to return to studying. And increasing your skills may open up new careers or opportunities in your professional life.
