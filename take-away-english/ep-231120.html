     Think of a caveman, and maybe you imagine someone tearing at the flesh of an animal they've just hunted. But this picture may be false – analysis of prehistoric remains suggests that Stone Age people were skilled in processing and cooking different kinds of seeds, even experimenting with different
     <strong>
      flavours
     </strong>
     . Seeds are still an important part of our
     <strong>
      diets
     </strong>
     , so maybe food choices haven't changed as much as we think.
    </p>
    <p>
     In
     <strong>
      botanical
     </strong>
     terms, seeds are what new plants grow from. Strictly speaking,
     <strong>
      edible
     </strong>
     seeds include
     <strong>
      nuts
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      pulses
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      grains
     </strong>
     , and are a significant source of
     <strong>
      protein
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      calories
     </strong>
     worldwide. Between them, rice and bread are
     <strong>
      staple foods
     </strong>
     in most of the world. Many cuisines use
     <strong>
      beans
     </strong>
     , whether cooked in stews or curries, or
     <strong>
      mashed
     </strong>
     into pastes, like hummus from the Middle East. This definition of seeds also includes coffee beans and the cocoa beans used to make chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Added to these are
     <strong>
      culinary seeds
     </strong>
     . These are what we more often think of as seeds – we often buy them unprocessed and use them whole in cooking, whether as a seasoning, as part of a salad or as a
     <strong>
      topping
     </strong>
     for bread. This includes
     <strong>
      chia seeds
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      sesame seeds
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      flaxseed
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     There are clear health benefits to including these seeds in our diet. They are high in
     <strong>
      dietary
     </strong>
     <strong>
      fibre
     </strong>
     , which is good for digestion and helps fight illnesses such as diabetes and bowel cancer. They are also a good source of
     <strong>
      unsaturated fat
     </strong>
     . Experts believe that using this to replace saturated fats, such as those from meat and dairy products, can lower
     <strong>
      cholesterol
     </strong>
     and help keep our heart healthy. The minerals contained in many culinary seeds, such as zinc, copper, and
     <strong>
      folate
     </strong>
     , can be beneficial for the immune system.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, it's not all good news. Seeds can cause an
     <strong>
      allergic
     </strong>
     reaction, especially sesame seeds. Sesame is one of the top ten causes of food allergies in the UK. Different types of seeds can share allergy-causing proteins, and other seeds that can cause allergies include sunflower seeds and poppy seeds.
