     我们中的许多人每天都有一部分时间被陌生人包围着，无论是在上下班的路上，还是坐在公园或咖啡馆里……但他们和我们只保持着陌生人的关系。然而，新的研究证据表明，与新认识的人开始一段对话可能对健康大有益处。本文讨论与陌生人交谈的好处。

     ‘It’s good to talk’, so some people say. When I commute into London, there are certainly plenty of people
     <strong>
      conversing
     </strong>
     on their mobile phones – sometimes too loudly – discussing and sharing personal details with a friend. For me, it’s strange that they talk as though the person is sitting next to them, when they don’t even acknowledge the person who is actually sitting beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many of us spend part of each day surrounded by strangers, whether on our daily commute, or sitting in a park or a cafe. But most of them remain just that – strangers. However, new evidence has shown that
     <strong>
      plucking up the courage
     </strong>
     to
     <strong>
      strike up
     </strong>
     a conversation might be good for our health.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicholas Epley from the University of Chicago and Juliana Schroeder from the University of California are behavioural scientists. They looked at this silent relationship and whether
     <strong>
      solitude
     </strong>
     is a more positive experience than
     <strong>
      interacting
     </strong>
     with strangers, or if people misunderstand the consequences of distant
     <strong>
      social connections
     </strong>
     . They found that many people feel
     <strong>
      uncomfortable
     </strong>
     and
     <strong>
      intimidated
     </strong>
     talking to others and their research suggested that when we make an initial conversation “we consistently
     <strong>
      underestimate
     </strong>
     how much a new person likes us.” It seems we carry a
     <strong>
      negative voice
     </strong>
     in our head telling us all the things that could go wrong and why someone wouldn’t want to converse with us.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their research involved an experiment with a group of Chicago commuters and found that “every participant in our experiment who actually tried to talk to a stranger found the person sitting next to them was happy to
     <strong>
      chat
     </strong>
     .” From this and other research, the conclusion is that
     <strong>
      connecting with
     </strong>
     strangers is surprisingly pleasant and it has a positive impact on our
     <strong>
      wellbeing
     </strong>
     . Gillian Sandstrom, a social psychologist from Essex University in the UK, told the BBC that “people are in a better
     <strong>
      mood
     </strong>
     after they reach out and have a conversation, however minimal.” It’s true that talking can make you feel happier and happiness can lead to better mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
     However, if you’re an
     <strong>
      introvert
     </strong>
     , the thought of speaking to someone new might make you
     <strong>
      anxious
     </strong>
     . But the American research found “both
     <strong>
      extroverts
     </strong>
     and introverts are happier when they are asked to behave in an extroverted manner.” So maybe, if you’re a loner, it’s time to
     <strong>
      come
     </strong>
     <strong>
      out of your shell
     </strong>
     and make some
     <strong>
      small talk
     </strong>
     with a stranger – it could be the beginning of a new friendship.
